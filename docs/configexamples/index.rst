Configuration Blueprints (autotest)
===================================

The next pages contains automatic full tested configuration examples.

Each lab will build an test from an external script.
The page content will generate, so changes will not take an effect.

A host ``vyos-oobm`` will use as a ssh proxy. This host is just
necessary for the Lab test.

The process will do the following steps:

1. create the lab on a eve-ng server
2. configure each host in the lab
3. do some defined tests
4. optional do an upgrade to a higher version and do step 3 again.
5. generate the documentation and include files
6. shutdown and destroy the lab, if there is no error
