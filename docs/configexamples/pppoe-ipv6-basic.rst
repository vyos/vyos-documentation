PPPoE IPv6 Basic Setup for Home Network
#######################################

This document is to describe a basic setup using PPPoE with DHCPv6-PD +
SLAAC to construct a typical home network. The user can follow the steps
described here to quickly setup a working network and use this as a starting
point to further configure or fine-tune other settings.

To achieve this, your ISP is required to support DHCPv6-PD. If you're not sure,
please contact your ISP for more information.

Network Topology

Configurations
==============

PPPoE Setup
-----------

.. code-block:: none

   set interfaces pppoe pppoe0 authentication password <YOUR PASSWORD>
   set interfaces pppoe pppoe0 authentication user <YOUR USERNAME>
   set interfaces pppoe pppoe0 service-name <YOUR SERVICENAME>
   set interfaces pppoe pppoe0 source-interface 'eth0'

* Fill ``password`` and ``user`` with the credential provided by your ISP.
* ``service-name`` can be an arbitrary string.

DHCPv6-PD Setup
---------------

During address configuration, in addition to assigning an address to the WAN
interface, ISP also provides a prefix to allow the router to configure addresses
of LAN interface and other nodes connecting to LAN, which is called prefix
delegation (PD).

.. code-block:: none

   set interfaces pppoe pppoe0 ipv6 address autoconf
   set interfaces pppoe pppoe0 dhcpv6-options pd 0 interface eth1 address '100'

* Here we use the prefix to configure the address of eth1 (LAN) to form
  ``<prefix>::64``, where ``64`` is hexadecimal of address 100.
* For home network users, most of time ISP only provides /64 prefix, hence
  there is no need to set SLA ID and prefix length. See :ref:`pppoe-interface`
  for more information.

Router Advertisement
--------------------

We need to enable router advertisement for LAN network so that PC can receive
the prefix and use SLAAC to configure the address automatically.

.. code-block:: none

   set service router-advert interface eth1 link-mtu '1492'
   set service router-advert interface eth1 name-server <NAME SERVER>
   set service router-advert interface eth1 prefix ::/64 valid-lifetime '172800'

* Set MTU in advertisement to 1492 because of PPPoE header overhead.
* Set DNS server address in the advertisement so that clients can obtain it by
  using RDNSS option. Most operating systems (Windows, Linux, Mac) should
  already support it.
* Here we set the prefix to ``::/64`` to indicate advertising any /64 prefix
  the LAN interface is assigned.
* Since some ISPs disconnects continuous connection for every 2~3 days, we set
  ``valid-lifetime`` to 2 days to allow PC for phasing out old address.

Basic Firewall
--------------

To have basic protection while keeping IPv6 network functional, we need to:

* Allow all established and related traffic for router and LAN
* Allow all icmpv6 packets for router and LAN
* Allow DHCPv6 packets for router

.. code-block:: none

   set firewall ipv6-name WAN_IN default-action 'drop'
   set firewall ipv6-name WAN_IN rule 10 action 'accept'
   set firewall ipv6-name WAN_IN rule 10 state established 'enable'
   set firewall ipv6-name WAN_IN rule 10 state related 'enable'
   set firewall ipv6-name WAN_IN rule 20 action 'accept'
   set firewall ipv6-name WAN_IN rule 20 protocol 'icmpv6'
   set firewall ipv6-name WAN_LOCAL default-action 'drop'
   set firewall ipv6-name WAN_LOCAL rule 10 action 'accept'
   set firewall ipv6-name WAN_LOCAL rule 10 state established 'enable'
   set firewall ipv6-name WAN_LOCAL rule 10 state related 'enable'
   set firewall ipv6-name WAN_LOCAL rule 20 action 'accept'
   set firewall ipv6-name WAN_LOCAL rule 20 protocol 'icmpv6'
   set firewall ipv6-name WAN_LOCAL rule 30 action 'accept'
   set firewall ipv6-name WAN_LOCAL rule 30 destination port '546'
   set firewall ipv6-name WAN_LOCAL rule 30 protocol 'udp'
   set firewall ipv6-name WAN_LOCAL rule 30 source port '547'
   set interfaces pppoe pppoe0 firewall in ipv6-name 'WAN_IN'
   set interfaces pppoe pppoe0 firewall local ipv6-name 'WAN_LOCAL'

Note to allow the router to receive DHCPv6 response from ISP. We need to allow
packets with source port 547 (server) and destination port 546 (client).
