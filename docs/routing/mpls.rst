MPLS 
****

**Multi-Protocol Label Switching** (initialized as MPLS) is a packet forwarding paradigm
which differs from regular IP forwarding. Instead of IP addresses being used to make the
decision on finding the exit interface, a router will instead use an exact match on a
32 bit/4 byte header called the MPLS label. This label is inserted between the ethernet
(layer 2) header and the IP (layer 3) header. One can statically or dynamically assign
label allocations, but we will focus on dynamic allocation of labels using some sort of
label distribution protocol (such as the aptly named Label Distribution Protocol / LDP,
Resource Reservation Protocol / RSVP, or Segment Routing through OSPF/ISIS). These
protocols allow for the creation of a unidirectional/unicast path called a labeled switched path
(initialized as LSP) throughout the network that operates very much like a tunnel through
the network. An easy way of thinking about how an MPLS LSP actually forwards traffic
throughout a network is to think of a GRE tunnel. They are not the same in how they
operate, but they are the same in how they handle the tunneled packet. It would be
good to think of MPLS as a tunneling technology that can be used to transport many
different types of packets, to aid in traffic engineering by allowing one to specify
paths throughout the network (using RSVP or SR), and to generally allow for easier
intra/inter network transport of data packets. For more information on how MPLS
label switching works, please go `here <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiprotocol_Label_Switching>`__. 


.. note:: MPLS support in VyOS is not finished yet, and therefore its functionality is limited. Currently there is no support for MPLS enabled VPN services such as L3VPNs, L2VPNs, and mVPNs. RSVP support is also not present as the underlying routing stack (FRR) does not implement it. Currently VyOS can be configured as a label switched router (MPLS P router), in both penultimate and ultimate hop popping operations.



Label Distribution Protocol
===========================

The **Multi-Protocol Label Switching** (MPLS) architecture does not 
assume a single protocol to create MPLS paths. VyOS supports the Label
Distribution Protocol (LDP) as implemented by FRR, based on `RFC 5036 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5036.html>`__.

LDP is a TCP based MPLS signaling protocol that distributes
labels creating MPLS label switched paths in a dynamic manner. 
LDP is not a routing protocol, as it relies on other routing 
protocols for forwarding decisions. LDP cannot bootstrap itself,
and therefore relies on said routing protocols for communication
with other routers that use LDP.

In order to allow for LDP on the local router to exchange label advertisements
with other routers, a TCP session will be established between automatically
discovered and statically assigned routers. LDP will try to establish a TCP
session to the **transport address** of other routers. Therefore for LDP to
function properly please make sure the transport address is shown in the
routing table and reachable to traffic at all times.

It is highly recommended to use the same address for both the LDP router-id and the
discovery transport address, but for VyOS MPLS LDP to work both parameters must
be explicitly set in the configuration.


Configuration Options
---------------------


Use this command to enable LDP, and enable MPLS processing on the interface you define.
   
  .. cfgcmd:: set protocols mpls ldp interface <interface>

Use this command to configure the IP address used as the LDP
router-id of the local device. 

  .. cfgcmd:: set protocols mpls ldp router-id <address>

Use this command to set the IPv4 or IPv6 transport-address used by
LDP.

  .. cfgcmd:: set protocols mpls ldp discovery transport-ipv4-address <IPv4 address>
  .. cfgcmd:: set protocols mpls ldp discovery transport-ipv6-address <IPv6 address>

Use this command to configure authentication for LDP peers. Set the
IP address of the LDP peer and a password that should be shared in
order to become neighbors.

  .. cfgcmd:: set protocols mpls ldp neighbor <IPv4 address> password <password>

Use this command if you would like to set the discovery
hello and hold time parameters.

  .. cfgcmd:: set protocols mpls ldp discovery hello-interval <seconds>
  .. cfgcmd:: set protocols mpls ldp discovery hello-holdtime <seconds>

Use this command if you would like to set the TCP session hold time
intervals.
   
  .. cfgcmd:: set protocols mpls ldp discovery session-ipv4-holdtime <seconds>
  .. cfgcmd:: set protocols mpls ldp discovery session-ipv6-holdtime <seconds>

Use this command if you would like for the router to advertise FECs with
a label of 0 for explicit null operations.
   
  .. cfgcmd:: set protocols mpls ldp export ipv4 explicit-null
  .. cfgcmd:: set protocols mpls ldp export ipv6 explicit-null



Sample configuration to setup LDP on VyOS

Show Commands
-------------

When LDP is working, you will be able to see label information in the
outcome of ``show ip route``. Besides that information, there are also
specific *show* commands for LDP: 

Use this command to see the Label Information Base.
   
  .. opcmd:: show mpls ldp binding




Use this command to see discovery hello information

  .. opcmd:: show mpls ldp discovery




Use this command to see LDP interface information

  .. opcmd:: show mpls ldp interface




Use this command to see LDP neighbor information

  .. opcmd:: show mpls ldp neighbor




Use this command to see detailed LDP neighbor information

  .. opcmd:: show mpls ldp neighbor detail



Reset Commands
--------------

Use this command to reset an LDP neighbor/TCP session that is established
   
  .. opcmd:: reset mpls ldp neighbor <IPv4 or IPv6 address>
