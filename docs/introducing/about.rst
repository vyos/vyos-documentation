VyOS is an open source network operating system based on Debian GNU/Linux.

VyOS provides a free routing platform that competes directly with other
commercially available solutions from well known network providers. Because
VyOS runs on standard amd64, i586 and ARM systems, it is able to be used
as a router and firewall platform for cloud deployments.

We use multiple live versions of our manual, hosted thankfully by
https://readthedocs.org. We will provide one version of the manual for every
VyOS major version starting with VyOS 1.2 which will receive Long-term support
(LTS).

The manual version is selected/specified by it's Git branch name. You can
switch between versions of the documentation by selecting the appropriate
branch on the bottom left corner.

VyOS CLI syntax may change between major (and sometimes minor) versions. Please
always refer to the documentation matching your current, running installation.
If a change in the CLI is required, VyOS will ship a so called migration script
which will take care of adjusting the syntax. No action needs to be taken by
you.
