IPv4 Firewall Configuration
###########################

********
Overview
********

In this section there's useful information on all firewall configuration that
can be done regarding IPv4, and appropriate op-mode commands.
Configuration commands covered in this section:

.. cfgcmd:: set firewall ipv4 ...

From the main structure defined in
:doc:`Firewall Overview</configuration/firewall/index>`
in this section you can find detailed information only for the next part
of the general structure:

.. code-block:: none

   - set firewall
       * ipv4
            - forward
               + filter
            - input
               + filter
            - output
               + filter
               + raw
            - prerouting
               + raw
            - name
               + custom_name

First, all traffic is received by the router, and it is processed in the
**prerouting** section.

This stage includes:

   * **Firewall Prerouting**: commands found under ``set firewall ipv4
     prerouting raw ...``
   * :doc:`Conntrack Ignore</configuration/system/conntrack>`: ``set system
     conntrack ignore ipv4...``
   * :doc:`Policy Route</configuration/policy/route>`: commands found under
     ``set policy route ...``
   * :doc:`Destination NAT</configuration/nat/nat44>`: commands found under
     ``set nat destination ...``

For transit traffic, which is received by the router and forwarded, the base
chain is **forward**. A simplified packet flow diagram for transit traffic is
shown next:

.. figure:: /_static/images/firewall-fwd-packet-flow.png

The base firewall chain to configure filtering rules for transit traffic
is ``set firewall ipv4 forward filter ...``, which happens in stage 5,
highlighted in the color red.

For traffic towards the router itself, the base chain is **input**, while
traffic originated by the router has the base chain **output**.
A new simplified packet flow diagram is shown next, which shows the path
for traffic destined to the router itself, and traffic generated by the
router (starting from circle number 6):

.. figure:: /_static/images/firewall-input-packet-flow.png

The base chain for traffic towards the router is ``set firewall ipv4 input
filter ...``

And the base chain for traffic generated by the router is ``set firewall ipv4
output ...``, where two sub-chains are available: **filter** and **raw**:

* **Output Prerouting**: ``set firewall ipv4 output raw ...``.
  As described in **Prerouting**, rules defined in this section are
  processed before connection tracking subsystem.
* **Output Filter**: ``set firewall ipv4 output filter ...``. Rules defined
  in this section are processed after connection tracking subsystem.

.. note:: **Important note about default-actions:**
   If a default action for any base chain is not defined, then the default
   action is set to **accept** for that chain. For custom chains, if the 
   default action is not defined, then the default-action is set to **drop**

Custom firewall chains can be created, with commands
``set firewall ipv4 name <name> ...``. In order to use
such custom chain, a rule with **action jump**, and the appropriate **target**
should be defined in a base chain.

*********************
Firewall - IPv4 Rules
*********************

For firewall filtering, firewall rules need to be created. Each rule is
numbered, has an action to apply if the rule is matched, and the ability
to specify multiple matching criteria. Data packets go through the rules
from 1 - 999999, so order is crucial. At the first match the action of the
rule will be executed.

Actions
=======

If a rule is defined, then an action must be defined for it. This tells the
firewall what to do if all of the criteria defined for that rule match.

The action can be :

   * ``accept``: accept the packet.

   * ``continue``: continue parsing next rule.

   * ``drop``: drop the packet.

   * ``reject``: reject the packet.

   * ``jump``: jump to another custom chain.

   * ``return``: Return from the current chain and continue at the next rule
     of the last chain.

   * ``queue``: Enqueue packet to userspace.

   * ``synproxy``: synproxy the packet.

.. cfgcmd:: set firewall ipv4 forward filter rule <1-999999> action
   [accept | continue | drop | jump | queue | reject | return | synproxy]
.. cfgcmd:: set firewall ipv4 input filter rule <1-999999> action
   [accept | continue | drop | jump | queue | reject | return | synproxy]
.. cfgcmd:: set firewall ipv4 output filter rule <1-999999> action
   [accept | continue | drop | jump | queue | reject | return]
.. cfgcmd:: set firewall ipv4 name <name> rule <1-999999> action
   [accept | continue | drop | jump | queue | reject | return]

   This required setting defines the action of the current rule. If the action
   is set to jump, then a jump-target is also needed.

.. cfgcmd:: set firewall ipv4 forward filter rule <1-999999>
   jump-target <text>
.. cfgcmd:: set firewall ipv4 input filter rule <1-999999>
   jump-target <text>
.. cfgcmd:: set firewall ipv4 output filter rule <1-999999>
   jump-target <text>
.. cfgcmd:: set firewall ipv4 name <name> rule <1-999999>
   jump-target <text>

   To be used only when action is set to ``jump``. Use this command to specify
   the jump target.

.. cfgcmd:: set firewall ipv4 forward filter rule <1-999999>
   queue <0-65535>
.. cfgcmd:: set firewall ipv4 input filter rule <1-999999>
   queue <0-65535>
.. cfgcmd:: set firewall ipv4 output filter rule <1-999999>
   queue <0-65535>
.. cfgcmd:: set firewall ipv4 name <name> rule <1-999999>
   queue <0-65535>

   To be used only when action is set to ``queue``. Use this command to specify
   the queue target to use. Queue range is also supported.

.. cfgcmd:: set firewall ipv4 forward filter rule <1-999999>
   queue-options bypass
.. cfgcmd:: set firewall ipv4 input filter rule <1-999999>
   queue-options bypass
.. cfgcmd:: set firewall ipv4 output filter rule <1-999999>
   queue-options bypass
.. cfgcmd:: set firewall ipv4 name <name> rule <1-999999>
   queue-options bypass

   To be used only when action is set to ``queue``. Use this command to let the
   packet go through firewall when no userspace software is connected to the
   queue.

.. cfgcmd:: set firewall ipv4 forward filter rule <1-999999>
   queue-options fanout
.. cfgcmd:: set firewall ipv4 input filter rule <1-999999>
   queue-options fanout
.. cfgcmd:: set firewall ipv4 output filter rule <1-999999>
   queue-options fanout
.. cfgcmd:: set firewall ipv4 name <name> rule <1-999999>
   queue-options fanout

   To be used only when action is set to ``queue``. Use this command to
   distribute packets between several queues.

Also, **default-action** is an action that takes place whenever a packet does
not match any rule in it's chain. For base chains, possible options for
**default-action** are **accept** or **drop**. 

.. cfgcmd:: set firewall ipv4 forward filter default-action
   [accept | drop]
.. cfgcmd:: set firewall ipv4 input filter default-action
   [accept | drop]
.. cfgcmd:: set firewall ipv4 output filter default-action
   [accept | drop]
.. cfgcmd:: set firewall ipv4 name <name> default-action
   [accept | drop | jump | queue | reject | return]

   This sets the default action of the rule-set if a packet does not match the
   criteria of any rule. If default-action is set to ``jump``, then
   ``default-jump-target`` is also needed. Note that for base chains, the
   default action can only be set to ``accept`` or ``drop``, while on custom 
   chains, more actions are available.

.. cfgcmd:: set firewall ipv4 name <name> default-jump-target <text>

   To be used only when ``default-action`` is set to ``jump``. Use this
   command to specify the jump target for the default rule.

.. note:: **Important note about default-actions:**
   If the default action for any base chain is not defined, then the default
   action is set to **accept** for that chain. For custom chains if a default
   action is not defined then the default-action is set to **drop**.

Firewall Logs
=============

Logging can be enable for every single firewall rule. If enabled, other
log options can be defined. 

.. cfgcmd:: set firewall ipv4 forward filter rule <1-999999> log
.. cfgcmd:: set firewall ipv4 input filter rule <1-999999> log
.. cfgcmd:: set firewall ipv4 output filter rule <1-999999> log
.. cfgcmd:: set firewall ipv4 name <name> rule <1-999999> log

   Enable logging for the matched packet. If this configuration command is not
   present, then the log is not enabled.

.. cfgcmd:: set firewall ipv4 forward filter default-log
.. cfgcmd:: set firewall ipv4 input filter default-log
.. cfgcmd:: set firewall ipv4 output filter default-log
.. cfgcmd:: set firewall ipv4 name <name> default-log

   log-options queue-threshold <0-65535>

   Define the number of packets to queue inside the kernel before sending them
   to userspace. Only applicable if rule log is enabled and log group is defined.

Firewall Description
====================

For reference, a description can be defined for every single rule, and for
every defined custom chain.

.. cfgcmd:: set firewall ipv4 name <name> description <text>

   Provide a rule-set description to a custom firewall chain.

.. cfgcmd:: set firewall ipv4 forward filter rule <1-999999>
   description <text>
.. cfgcmd:: set firewall ipv4 input filter rule <1-999999>
   description <text>
.. cfgcmd:: set firewall ipv4 output filter rule <1-999999>
   description <text>
.. cfgcmd:: set firewall ipv4 name <name> rule <1-999999> description <text>

   Provide a description for each rule.

Rule Status
===========

When defining a rule, it is enabled by default. In some cases, it is useful to
just disable the rule, rather than removing it.

.. cfgcmd:: set firewall ipv4 forward filter rule <1-999999> disable
.. cfgcmd:: set firewall ipv4 input filter rule <1-999999> disable
.. cfgcmd:: set firewall ipv4 output filter rule <1-999999> disable
.. cfgcmd:: set firewall ipv4 name <name> rule <1-999999> disable

   Command for disabling a rule but keep it in the configuration.

Matching criteria
=================

There are a lot of matching criteria against which the packet can be tested.

.. cfgcmd:: set firewall ipv4 forward filter rule <1-999999>
   connection-status nat [destination | source]
.. cfgcmd:: set firewall ipv4 input filter rule <1-999999>
   connection-status nat [destination | source]
.. cfgcmd:: set firewall ipv4 output filter rule <1-999999>
   connection-status nat [destination | source]
.. cfgcmd:: set firewall ipv4 name <name> rule <1-999999>
   connection-status nat [destination | source]

   Match based on nat connection status.

.. cfgcmd:: set firewall ipv4 forward filter rule <1-999999>
   connection-mark <1-2147483647>

   conntrack-helper <module>

   Match based on connection tracking protocol helper module to secure use of 
   that helper module. See below for possible completions `<module>`. 

   .. code-block:: none

      Possible completions:
      ftp                  Related traffic from FTP helper
      h323                 Related traffic from H.323 helper

.. cfgcmd:: set firewall ipv4 forward filter rule <1-999999>
   source address [address | addressrange | CIDR]
.. cfgcmd:: set firewall ipv4 input filter rule <1-999999>
   source address [address | addressrange | CIDR]
.. cfgcmd:: set firewall ipv4 output filter rule <1-999999>
   source address [address | addressrange | CIDR]
.. cfgcmd:: set firewall ipv4 name <name> rule <1-999999>
   source address [address | addressrange | CIDR]

.. cfgcmd:: set firewall ipv4 forward filter rule <1-999999>
   destination address [address | addressrange | CIDR]

   destination address [address | addressrange | CIDR]
.. cfgcmd:: set firewall ipv4 name <name> rule <1-999999>
   destination address [address | addressrange | CIDR]

   Match criteria based on source and/or destination address. This is similar
   to the network groups part, but here you are able to negate the matching
   addresses.

   .. code-block:: none

      set firewall ipv4 name FOO rule 50 source address 192.0.2.10-192.0.2.11
      # with a '!' the rule match everything except the specified subnet
      set firewall ipv4 input filter FOO rule 51 source address !203.0.113.0/24

.. cfgcmd:: set firewall ipv4 forward filter rule <1-999999>
   source address-mask [address]

   destination address-mask [address]
.. cfgcmd:: set firewall ipv4 name <name> rule <1-999999>
   destination address-mask [address]

   An arbitrary netmask can be applied to mask addresses to only match against
   a specific portion.
   
   This functions for both individual addresses and address groups.

   .. code-block:: none

      # Match any IPv4 address with `11` as the 2nd octet and `13` as the forth octet
      set firewall ipv4 name FOO rule 100 destination address 0.11.0.13
      set firewall ipv4 name FOO rule 100 destination address-mask 0.255.0.255

   destination fqdn <fqdn>
.. cfgcmd:: set firewall ipv4 output filter rule <1-999999>
   destination fqdn <fqdn>
.. cfgcmd:: set firewall ipv4 name <name> rule <1-999999>
   destination fqdn <fqdn>

   Specify a Fully Qualified Domain Name as source/destination to match. Ensure
   that the router is able to resolve this dns query.

   destination geoip inverse-match
.. cfgcmd:: set firewall ipv4 name <name> rule <1-999999>
   destination geoip inverse-match

   Match IP addresses based on its geolocation. More info: `geoip matching
   <https://wiki.nftables.org/wiki-nftables/index.php/GeoIP_matching>`_.
   Use inverse-match to match anything except the given country-codes.

   source mac-address <mac-address>
.. cfgcmd:: set firewall ipv4 name <name> rule <1-999999>
   source mac-address <mac-address>

   You can only specify a source mac-address to match.

   .. code-block:: none

      set firewall ipv4 input filter rule 100 source mac-address 00:53:00:11:22:33
      set firewall ipv4 input filter rule 101 source mac-address !00:53:00:aa:12:34

.. cfgcmd:: set firewall ipv4 name <name> rule <1-999999>
   destination port [1-65535 | portname | start-end]

   A port can be set by number or name as defined in ``/etc/services``.

   .. code-block:: none

      set firewall ipv4 forward filter rule 10 source port '22'
      set firewall ipv4 forward filter rule 11 source port '!http'
      set firewall ipv4 forward filter rule 12 source port 'https'

   Multiple source ports can be specified as a comma-separated list.
   The whole list can also be "negated" using ``!``. For example:

.. cfgcmd:: set firewall ipv4 forward filter rule <1-999999>
   source group address-group <name | !name>
.. cfgcmd:: set firewall ipv4 input filter rule <1-999999>
   source group address-group <name | !name>

   destination group address-group <name | !name>
.. cfgcmd:: set firewall ipv4 name <name> rule <1-999999>
   destination group address-group <name | !name>

   Use a specific address-group. Prepending the character ``!`` to invert the
   criteria to match is also supported.

.. cfgcmd:: set firewall ipv4 forward filter rule <1-999999>
   source group dynamic-address-group <name | !name>
.. cfgcmd:: set firewall ipv4 input filter rule <1-999999>

   destination group dynamic-address-group <name | !name>
.. cfgcmd:: set firewall ipv4 name <name> rule <1-999999>
   destination group dynamic-address-group <name | !name>

   Use a specific dynamic-address-group. Prepending the character ``!`` to
   invert the criteria to match is also supported.

.. cfgcmd:: set firewall ipv4 forward filter rule <1-999999>
   source group network-group <name | !name>
