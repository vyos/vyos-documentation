Bridge Firewall Configuration

.. note:: **Documentation under development**

********
Overview
********

In this section there's useful information of all firewall configuration that
can be done regarding bridge, and appropiate op-mode commands.
Configuration commands covered in this section:

.. cfgcmd:: set firewall bridge ...

From main structure defined in :doc:`Firewall Overview</configuration/firewall/index>`
in this section you can find detailed information only for the next part
of the general structure:

.. code-block:: none

   - set firewall
       * bridge
            - forward
               + filter
            - name
               + custom_name

Traffic which is received by the router on an interface which is member of a
bridge is processed on the **Bridge Layer**. A simplified packet flow diagram
for this layer is shown next:

.. figure:: /_static/images/firewall-bridge-packet-flow.png

For traffic that needs to be forwared internally by the bridge, base chain is
is **forward**, and it's base command for filtering is ``set firewall bridge
forward filter ...``, which happens in stage 4, highlightened with red color.

Custom bridge firewall chains can be create with command ``set firewall bridge
name <name> ...``. In order to use such custom chain, a rule with action jump,
and the appropiate target should be defined in a base chain.

.. note:: **Layer 3 bridge**:
      When an IP address is assigned to the bridge interface, and if traffic
      is sent to the router to this IP (for example using such IP as
      default gateway), then rules defined for **bridge firewall** won't
      match, and firewall analysis continues at **IP layer**.

************
Bridge Rules
************

For firewall filtering, firewall rules needs to be created. Each rule is
numbered, has an action to apply if the rule is matched, and the ability
to specify multiple criteria matchers. Data packets go through the rules
from 1 - 999999, so order is crucial. At the first match the action of the
rule will be executed.

Actions
=======

If a rule is defined, then an action must be defined for it. This tells the
firewall what to do if all criteria matchers defined for such rule do match.

In firewall bridge rules, the action can be:

   * ``accept``: accept the packet.

   * ``continue``: continue parsing next rule.

   * ``drop``: drop the packet.

   * ``jump``: jump to another custom chain.

   * ``return``: Return from the current chain and continue at the next rule
     of the last chain.

   * ``queue``: Enqueue packet to userspace.

.. cfgcmd:: set firewall bridge forward filter rule <1-999999> action
   [accept | continue | drop | jump | queue | return]
.. cfgcmd:: set firewall bridge name <name> rule <1-999999> action
   [accept | continue | drop | jump | queue | return]

   This required setting defines the action of the current rule. If action is
   set to jump, then jump-target is also needed.

.. cfgcmd:: set firewall bridge forward filter rule <1-999999>
   jump-target <text>
.. cfgcmd:: set firewall bridge name <name> rule <1-999999>
   jump-target <text>

.. cfgcmd:: set firewall bridge forward filter rule <1-999999>
   queue <0-65535>
.. cfgcmd:: set firewall bridge name <name> rule <1-999999>
   queue <0-65535>

   To be used only when action is set to ``queue``. Use this command to specify
   queue target to use. Queue range is also supported.

.. cfgcmd:: set firewall bridge forward filter rule <1-999999>
   queue-options bypass
.. cfgcmd:: set firewall bridge name <name> rule <1-999999>
   queue-options bypass

   To be used only when action is set to ``queue``. Use this command to let
   packet go through firewall when no userspace software is connected to the
   queue.

.. cfgcmd:: set firewall bridge forward filter rule <1-999999>
   queue-options fanout
.. cfgcmd:: set firewall bridge name <name> rule <1-999999>
   queue-options fanout

   To be used only when action is set to ``queue``. Use this command to
   distribute packets between several queues.

Also, **default-action** is an action that takes place whenever a packet does
not match any rule in it's chain. For base chains, possible options for
**default-action** are **accept** or **drop**.

.. cfgcmd:: set firewall bridge forward filter default-action
   [accept | drop]
.. cfgcmd:: set firewall bridge name <name> default-action
   [accept | continue | drop | jump | queue | return]

   This set the default action of the rule-set if no rule matched a packet
   criteria. If default-action is set to ``jump``, then
   ``default-jump-target`` is also needed. Note that for base chains, default
   action can only be set to ``accept`` or ``drop``, while on custom chain,
   more actions are available.

.. cfgcmd:: set firewall bridge name <name> default-jump-target <text>

   To be used only when ``defult-action`` is set to ``jump``. Use this
   command to specify jump target for default rule.

.. note:: **Important note about default-actions:**
   If default action for any base chain is not defined, then the default
   action is set to **accept** for that chain. For custom chains, if default
   action is not defined, then the default-action is set to **drop**.

Firewall Logs
=============

Logging can be enable for every single firewall rule. If enabled, other
log options can be defined.

.. cfgcmd:: set firewall bridge forward filter rule <1-999999> log
.. cfgcmd:: set firewall bridge name <name> rule <1-999999> log

   Enable logging for the matched packet. If this configuration command is not
   present, then log is not enabled.

.. cfgcmd:: set firewall bridge forward filter default-log
.. cfgcmd:: set firewall bridge name <name> default-log

   Use this command to enable the logging of the default action on
   the specified chain.

.. cfgcmd:: set firewall bridge forward filter rule <1-999999>
   log-options level [emerg | alert | crit | err | warn | notice
   | info | debug]
.. cfgcmd:: set firewall bridge name <name> rule <1-999999>
   log-options level [emerg | alert | crit | err | warn | notice
   | info | debug]

   Define log-level. Only applicable if rule log is enable.

.. cfgcmd:: set firewall bridge forward filter rule <1-999999>
   log-options group <0-65535>
.. cfgcmd:: set firewall bridge name <name> rule <1-999999>
   log-options group <0-65535>

   Define log group to send message to. Only applicable if rule log is enable.

.. cfgcmd:: set firewall bridge forward filter rule <1-999999>
   log-options snapshot-length <0-9000>
.. cfgcmd:: set firewall bridge name <name> rule <1-999999>
   log-options snapshot-length <0-9000>

   Define length of packet payload to include in netlink message. Only
   applicable if rule log is enable and log group is defined.

.. cfgcmd:: set firewall bridge forward filter rule <1-999999>
   log-options queue-threshold <0-65535>
.. cfgcmd:: set firewall bridge name <name> rule <1-999999>
   log-options queue-threshold <0-65535>

   Define number of packets to queue inside the kernel before sending them to
   userspace. Only applicable if rule log is enable and log group is defined.

Firewall Description
====================

For reference, a description can be defined for every defined custom chain.

.. cfgcmd:: set firewall bridge name <name> description <text>

   Provide a rule-set description to a custom firewall chain.

Rule Status
===========

When defining a rule, it is enable by default. In some cases, it is useful to
just disable the rule, rather than removing it.

.. cfgcmd:: set firewall bridge forward filter rule <1-999999> disable
.. cfgcmd:: set firewall bridge name <name> rule <1-999999> disable

   Command for disabling a rule but keep it in the configuration.

Matching criteria
=================

There are a lot of matching criteria against which the packet can be tested.

.. cfgcmd:: set firewall bridge forward filter rule <1-999999>
   destination mac-address <mac-address>
.. cfgcmd:: set firewall bridge name <name> rule <1-999999>
   destination mac-address <mac-address>
.. cfgcmd:: set firewall bridge forward filter rule <1-999999>
   source mac-address <mac-address>
.. cfgcmd:: set firewall bridge name <name> rule <1-999999>
   source mac-address <mac-address>

   Match criteria based on source and/or destination mac-address.

.. cfgcmd:: set firewall bridge forward filter rule <1-999999>
   inbound-interface name <iface>
.. cfgcmd:: set firewall bridge name <name> rule <1-999999>
   inbound-interface name <iface>
