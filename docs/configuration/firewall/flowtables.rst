Flowtables Firewall Configuration

Overview
********

In this section there's useful information of all firewall configuration that
can be done regarding flowtables.

.. cfgcmd:: set firewall flowtables ...

From main structure defined in :doc:`Firewall Overview</configuration/firewall/index>`
in this section you can find detailed information only for the next part
of the general structure:

.. code-block:: none

   - set firewall
       * flowtable
            - custom_flow_table
               + ...


Flowtables  allows you to define a fastpath through the flowtable datapath.
The flowtable supports for the layer 3 IPv4 and IPv6 and the layer 4 TCP
and UDP protocols.

.. figure:: /_static/images/firewall-flowtable-packet-flow.png

Once the first packet of the flow successfully goes through the IP forwarding
path (black circles path), from the second packet on, you might decide to
offload the flow to the flowtable through your ruleset. The flowtable
infrastructure provides a rule action that allows you to specify when to add
a flow to the flowtable (On forward filtering, red circle number 6)

A packet that finds a matching entry in the flowtable (flowtable hit) is
transmitted to the output netdevice, hence, packets bypass the classic IP
forwarding path and uses the **Fast Path** (orange circles path). The visible
effect is that you do not see these packets from any of the Netfilter
hooks coming after ingress. In case that there is no matching entry in the
flowtable (flowtable miss), the packet follows the classic IP forwarding path.

***********************
Flowtable Configuration
***********************

In order to use flowtables, the minimal configuration needed includes:

   * Create flowtable: create flowtable, which includes the interfaces
     that are going to be used by the flowtable.

   * Create firewall rule: create a firewall rule, setting action to
     ``offload`` and using desired flowtable for ``offload-target``.

Creating a flow table:

.. cfgcmd:: set firewall flowtable <flow_table_name> interface <iface>

   Define interfaces to be used in the flowtable.

.. cfgcmd:: set firewall flowtable <flow_table_name> description <text>

Provide a description to the flow table.

.. cfgcmd:: set firewall flowtable <flow_table_name> offload
   <hardware | software>

   Define type of offload to be used by the flowtable: ``hardware`` or
   ``software``. By default, ``software`` offload is used.

.. note:: **Hardware offload:** should be supported by the NICs used.

Creating rules for using flow tables:

.. cfgcmd:: set firewall [ipv4 | ipv4] forward filter rule <1-999999>
   action offload

   Create firewall rule in forward chain, and set action to ``offload``.

.. cfgcmd:: set firewall [ipv4 | ipv4] forward filter rule <1-999999>
   offload-target <flowtable>

   Create firewall rule in forward chain, and define which flowtbale
   should be used. Only applicable if action is ``offload``.

*********************
Configuration Example
*********************

Things to be considred in this setup:

   * Two interfaces are going to be used in the flowtables: eth0 and eth1

   * Minumum firewall ruleset is provided, which includes some filtering rules,
     and appropiate rules for using flowtable offload capabilities.

As described, first packet will be evaluated by all the firewall path, so
desired connection should be explicitely accepted. Same thing should be taken
into account for traffic in reverse order. In most cases state policies are
used in order to accept connection in reverse patch.

We will only accept traffic comming from interface eth0, protocol tcp and
destination port 1122. All other traffic traspassing the router should be
blocked.

Commands
--------

.. code-block:: none

      set firewall flowtable FT01 interface 'eth0'
      set firewall flowtable FT01 interface 'eth1'
      set firewall ipv4 forward filter default-action 'drop'
      set firewall ipv4 forward filter rule 10 action 'offload'
      set firewall ipv4 forward filter rule 10 offload-target 'FT01'
      set firewall ipv4 forward filter rule 10 state 'established'
      set firewall ipv4 forward filter rule 10 state 'related'
      set firewall ipv4 forward filter rule 20 action 'accept'
      set firewall ipv4 forward filter rule 20 state 'established'
      set firewall ipv4 forward filter rule 20 state 'related'
      set firewall ipv4 forward filter rule 110 action 'accept'
      set firewall ipv4 forward filter rule 110 destination address '192.0.2.100'
      set firewall ipv4 forward filter rule 110 destination port '1122'
      set firewall ipv4 forward filter rule 110 inbound-interface name 'eth0'
      set firewall ipv4 forward filter rule 110 protocol 'tcp'

Explanation
-----------

Analysis on what happens for desired connection:

   1. First packet is received on eht0, with destination address 192.0.2.100,
   protocol tcp and destination port 1122. Assume such destination address is
   reachable through interface eth1.

   2. Since this is the first packet, connection status of this connection,
   so far is **new**. So neither rule 10 nor 20 are valid.

   3. Rule 110 is hit, so connection is accepted.

   4. Once answer from server 192.0.2.100 is seen in opposite direction,
   connection state will be triggered to **established**, so this reply is
   accepted in rule 10.

   5. Second packet for this connection is received by the router. Since
   connection state is **established**, then rule 10 is hit, and a new entry
   in the flowtable FT01 is added for this connection.

   6. All subsecuent packets will skip traditional path, and will be offloaded
   and will use the **Fast Path**.

Checks
------

It's time to check conntrack table, to see if any connection was accepted,
and if was properly offloaded

.. code-block:: none
