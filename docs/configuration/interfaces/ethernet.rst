This will be the most widely used interface on a router carrying traffic to the
real world.

Configuration
*************

Common interface configuration
==============================

.. cmdinclude:: /_include/interface-common-with-dhcp.txt
   :var0: ethernet
   :var1: eth0

Ethernet options
================

.. cfgcmd:: set interfaces ethernet <interface> duplex <auto | full | half>

   Configure physical interface duplex setting.

   * auto - interface duplex setting is auto-negotiated
   * full - always use full-duplex
   * half - always use half-duplex

   VyOS default will be `auto`.

.. cfgcmd:: set interfaces ethernet <interface> speed <auto | 10 | 100 | 1000 |
  2500 | 5000 | 10000 | 25000 | 40000 | 50000 | 100000>

   Configure physical interface speed setting.

   * auto - interface speed is auto-negotiated
   * 10 - 10 MBit/s
   * 100 - 100 MBit/s
   * 1000 - 1 GBit/s
   * 2500 - 2.5 GBit/s
   * 5000 - 5 GBit/s
   * 10000 - 10 GBit/s
   * 25000 - 25 GBit/s
   * 40000 - 40 GBit/s
   * 50000 - 50 GBit/s
   * 100000 - 100 GBit/s

   VyOS default will be `auto`.


Offloading
----------

.. cfgcmd:: set interfaces ethernet <interface> offload <gro | gso | lro | rps |
  sg | tso>

  Enable different types of hardware offloading on the given NIC.

  :abbr:`LRO (Large Receive Offload)` is a technique designed to boost the
  efficiency of how your computer's network interface card (NIC) processes
  incoming network traffic. Typically, network data arrives in smaller chunks
  called packets. Processing each packet individually consumes CPU (central
  processing unit) resources. Lots of small packets can lead to a performance
  bottleneck. Instead of handing the CPU each packet as it comes in, LRO
  instructs the NIC to combine multiple incoming packets into a single, larger
  packet. This larger packet is then passed to the CPU for processing.

  .. note:: Under some circumstances, LRO is known to modify the packet headers
     of forwarded traffic, which breaks the end-to-end principle of computer
     networking. LRO is also only able to offload TCP segments encapsulated in
     IPv4 packets. Due to these limitations, it is recommended to use GRO
     (Generic Receive Offload) where possible. More information on the
     limitations of LRO can be found here: https://lwn.net/Articles/358910/

  :abbr:`GSO (Generic Segmentation Offload)` is a pure software offload that is
  meant to deal with cases where device drivers cannot perform the offloads
  described above. What occurs in GSO is that a given skbuff will have its data
  broken out over multiple skbuffs that have been resized to match the MSS
  provided via skb_shinfo()->gso_size.

  Before enabling any hardware segmentation offload a corresponding software
  offload is required in GSO. Otherwise it becomes possible for a frame to be
  re-routed between devices and end up being unable to be transmitted.

  :abbr:`GRO (Generic receive offload)` is the complement to GSO. Ideally any
  frame assembled by GRO should be segmented to create an identical sequence of
  frames using GSO, and any sequence of frames segmented by GSO should be able
  to be reassembled back to the original by GRO. The only exception to this is
  IPv4 ID in the case that the DF bit is set for a given IP header. If the
  value of the IPv4 ID is not sequentially incrementing it will be altered so
  that it is when a frame assembled via GRO is segmented via GSO.

  :abbr:`RPS (Receive Packet Steering)` is logically a software implementation
  of :abbr:`RSS (Receive Side Scaling)`. Being in software, it is necessarily
  called later in the datapath. Whereas RSS selects the queue and hence CPU that
  will run the hardware interrupt handler, RPS selects the CPU to perform
  protocol processing above the interrupt handler. This is accomplished by
  placing the packet on the desired CPU's backlog queue and waking up the CPU
  for processing. RPS has some advantages over RSS:

  - it can be used with any NIC
  - software filters can easily be added to hash over new protocols
  - it does not increase hardware device interrupt rate, although it does
    introduce inter-processor interrupts (IPIs)

  .. note:: In order to use TSO/LRO with VMXNET3 adapters, the SG offloading
     option must also be enabled.
