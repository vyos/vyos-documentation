Zone-based Firewall Policy
--------------------------

As an alternative to applying policy to an interface directly, a zone-based
firewall can be created to simplify configuration when multiple interfaces
belong to the same security zone. Instead of applying to rulesets to interfaces
they are applied to source zone-destination zone pairs.

An example to zone-based firewalls can be found here: :ref:`examples-zone-policy`.
