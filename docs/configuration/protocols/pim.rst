####################################
PIM – Protocol Independent Multicast
####################################

VyOS supports :abbr:`PIM-SM (PIM Sparse Mode)` as well as
:abbr:`IGMP (Internet Group Management Protocol)` v2 and v3

:abbr:`PIM (Protocol Independent Multicast)` must be configured in every
interface of every participating router. Every router must also have the
location of the Rendevouz Point manually configured. Then, unidirectional
shared trees rooted at the Rendevouz Point will automatically be built
for multicast distribution.

Traffic from multicast sources will go to the Rendezvous Point, and
receivers will pull it from a shared tree using :abbr:`IGMP (Internet
Group Management Protocol)`.

Multicast receivers will talk IGMP to their local router, so, besides
having PIM configured in every router, IGMP must also be configured in
any router where there could be a multicast receiver locally connected.

VyOS supports both IGMP version 2 and version 3 (which allows
source-specific multicast).

************************
PIM-SM - PIM Sparse Mode
************************

.. cfgcmd:: set protocols pim ecmp

   If PIM has the a choice of ECMP nexthops for a particular
   :abbr:`RPF (Reverse Path Forwarding)`, PIM will cause S,G flows to be
   spread out amongst the nexthops. If this command is not specified then
   the first nexthop found will be used.

.. cfgcmd:: set protocols pim ecmp rebalance

   If PIM is using ECMP and an interface goes down, cause PIM to rebalance all
   S,G flows across the remaining nexthops. If this command is not configured
   PIM only modifies those S,G flows that were using the interface that went
   down.

.. cfgcmd:: set protocols pim join-prune-interval <n>

   Modify the join/prune interval that PIM uses to the new value. Time is
   specified in seconds.

   The default time is 60 seconds.

   If you enter a value smaller than 60 seconds be aware that this can and
   will affect convergence at scale.

.. cfgcmd:: set protocols pim keep-alive-timer <n>

   Modify the time out value for a S,G flow from 1-65535 seconds. If choosing
   a value below 31 seconds be aware that some hardware platforms cannot see
   data flowing in better than 30 second chunks.

.. cfgcmd:: set protocols pim packets <n>

   When processing packets from a neighbor process the number of packets
   incoming at one time before moving on to the next task.

   The default value is 3 packets.

   This command is only useful at scale when you can possibly have a large
   number of PIM control packets flowing.

.. cfgcmd:: set protocols pim register-accept-list <prefix-list>

   When PIM receives a register packet the source of the packet will be compared
   to the prefix-list specified, and if a permit is received normal processing
   continues. If a deny is returned for the source address of the register packet
   a register stop message is sent to the source.

.. cfgcmd:: set protocols pim register-suppress-time <n>

   Modify the time that pim will register suppress a FHR will send register
   notifications to the kernel.

.. cfgcmd:: set protocols pim rp <address> group <group>

   In order to use PIM, it is necessary to configure a :abbr:`RP (Rendezvous Point)`
   for join messages to be sent to. Currently the only methodology to do this is
   via static rendezvous point commands.

   All routers in the PIM network must agree on these values.

   The first ip address is the RP's address and the second value is the matching
   prefix of group ranges covered.

.. cfgcmd:: set protocols pim rp keep-alive-timer <n>

   Modify the time out value for a S,G flow from 1-65535 seconds at
   :abbr:`RP (Rendezvous Point)`. The normal keepalive period for the KAT(S,G)
   defaults to 210 seconds. However, at the :abbr:`RP (Rendezvous Point)`, the
   keepalive period must be at least the Register_Suppression_Time, or the RP
   may time out the (S,G) state before the next Null-Register arrives.
   Thus, the KAT(S,G) is set to max(Keepalive_Period, RP_Keepalive_Period)
   when a Register-Stop is sent.

   If choosing a value below 31 seconds be aware that some hardware platforms
   cannot see data flowing in better than 30 second chunks.

   See :rfc:`7761#section-4.1` for details.

.. cfgcmd:: set protocols pim no-v6-secondary

   When sending PIM hello packets tell PIM to not send any v6 secondary
   addresses on the interface. This information is used to allow PIM to use v6
   nexthops in it's decision for :abbr:`RPF (Reverse Path Forwarding)` lookup
   if this option is not set (default).

.. cfgcmd:: set protocols pim spt-switchover infinity-and-beyond [prefix-list <list>]

   On the last hop router if it is desired to not switch over to the SPT tree
   configure this command.

   Optional parameter prefix-list can be use to control which groups to switch or
   not switch. If a group is PERMIT as per the prefix-list, then the SPT switchover
   does not happen for it and if it is DENY, then the SPT switchover happens.

.. cfgcmd:: set protocols pim ssm prefix-list <list>

   Specify a range of group addresses via a prefix-list that forces PIM to never
   do :abbr:`SSM (Source-Specific Multicast)` over.

Interface specific commands
===========================

.. cfgcmd:: set protocols pim interface <interface> bfd [profile <name>]

   Automatically create BFD session for each RIP peer discovered in this
   interface. When the BFD session monitor signalize that the link is down
   the RIP peer is removed and all the learned routes associated with that
   peer are removed.

   If optional profile parameter is used, select a BFD profile for the BFD
   sessions created via this interface.

.. cfgcmd:: set protocols pim interface <interface> dr-priority <n>

   Set the :abbr:`DR (Designated Router)` Priority for the interface.
   This command is useful to allow the user to influence what node becomes
   the DR for a LAN segment.

.. cfgcmd:: set protocols pim interface <interface> hello <n>

   Set the PIM hello and hold interval for a interface.

.. cfgcmd:: set protocols pim interface <interface> no-bsm

   Tell PIM that we would not like to use this interface to process
   bootstrap messages.

.. cfgcmd:: set protocols pim interface <interface> no-unicast-bsm

   Tell PIM that we would not like to use this interface to process
   unicast bootstrap messages.

.. cfgcmd:: set protocols pim interface <interface> passive

   Disable sending and receiving PIM control packets on the interface.

 .. cfgcmd:: set protocols pim interface <interface> source-address <ip-address>

   If you have multiple addresses configured on a particular interface and would
   like PIM to use a specific source address associated with that interface.

******************************************
IGMP - Internet Group Management Protocol)
******************************************

.. cfgcmd:: set protocols pim igmp watermark-warning <n>

   Configure watermark warning generation for an IGMP group limit. Generates
   warning once the configured group limit is reached while adding new groups.

.. _pim:igmp_interface_commands:

Interface specific commands
===========================

.. cfgcmd:: set protocols pim interface <interface> igmp
   join <multicast-address> source-address <IP-address>

   Use this command to allow the selected interface to join a multicast
   group defining the multicast address you want to join and the source
   IP address too.

.. cfgcmd:: set protocols pim interface <interface> igmp
   query-interval <seconds>

   Use this command to configure in the selected interface the IGMP
   host query interval (1-1800) in seconds that PIM will use.

.. cfgcmd:: set protocols pim interface <interface> igmp
   query-max-response-time <n>

   Use this command to configure in the selected interface the IGMP
   query response timeout value (10-250) in deciseconds. If a report is
   not returned in the specified time, it will be assumed the (S,G) or
   (\*,G) state :rfc:`7761#section-4.1` has timed out.

.. cfgcmd:: set protocols pim interface <interface> igmp version <version-number>

   Use this command to define in the selected interface whether you
   choose IGMP version 2 or 3.

   The default value is 3.
