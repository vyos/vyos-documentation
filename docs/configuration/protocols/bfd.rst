BFD
###

:abbr:`BFD (Bidirectional Forwarding Detection)` is described and extended by
the following RFCs: :rfc:`5880`, :rfc:`5881` and :rfc:`5883`.

In the age of very fast networks, a second of unreachability can means millions of packet loss. The idea behind BFD is to detect very quickly when a peer is down and take action extremely fast. 

For example without BFD, when a BGP or OSPF peer is unreachable but if the interface is still up it needs to wait for the timeout to expires to conludes that a peer is unreachable.

BFD uses small UDP packet very quickly to ensures that the peer is still alive.

Configure BFD
=============

.. cfgcmd:: set protocols bfd peer <address>

   Set BFD peer IPv4 address or IPv6 address

.. cfgcmd:: set protocols bfd peer <address> echo-mode

   Enables the echo transmission mode

.. cfgcmd:: set protocols bfd peer <address> multihop

   Allow this BFD peer to not be directly connected

.. cfgcmd:: set protocols bfd peer <address> source 
   [address <address> | interface <interface>]

   Bind listener to specifid interface/address, mandatory for IPv6

.. cfgcmd:: set protocols bfd peer <address> interval echo-interval <10-60000>

   The minimal echo receive transmission interval that this system is
   capable of handling

.. cfgcmd:: set protocols bfd peer <address> interval multiplier <2-255>

   Remote transmission interval will be multiplied by this value

.. cfgcmd:: set protocols bfd peer <address> interval 
   [receive | transmit] <10-60000>

   Interval in milliseconds

.. cfgcmd:: set protocols bfd peer <address> shutdown

   Disable a BFD peer


Enable BFD in BGP
-----------------

.. cfgcmd:: set protocols bgp <asn> neighbor <address> bfd

   Enable BFD on a single BGP neighbor

.. cfgcmd:: set protocols bgp <asn> peer-group <group> bfd

   Enable BFD on a BGP peer group



Enable BFD in OSPF
------------------

.. cfgcmd:: set interfaces ethernet <ethN> ip ospf bfd

   Enable BFD for ospf on a interface

.. cfgcmd:: set interfaces ethernet <ethN> ipv6 ospfv3 bfd

   Enable BFD for ospfv3 on a interface



Operational Commands
====================

.. opcmd:: show protocols bfd peer

   Show all BFD peers

   .. code-block:: none
