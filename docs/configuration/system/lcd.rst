System Display (LCD)
********************

The system LCD :abbr:`LCD (Liquid-crystal display)` option is for users running
VyOS on hardware that features an LCD display. This is typically a small display
built in an 19 inch rack-mountable appliance. Those displays are used to show
runtime data.

To configure your LCD display you must first identify the used hardware, and
connectivity of the display to your system. This can be any serial port
(`ttySxx`) or serial via USB or even old parallel port interfaces.
