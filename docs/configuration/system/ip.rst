System configuration commands
-----------------------------

.. cfgcmd:: set system ip disable-forwarding

   Use this command to disable IPv4 forwarding on all interfaces.

.. cfgcmd:: set system ip disable-directed-broadcast

   Use this command to disable IPv4 directed broadcast forwarding on all
   interfaces.

   If set, IPv4 directed broadcast forwarding will be completely disabled
   regardless of whether per-interface directed broadcast forwarding is
   enabled or not.

.. cfgcmd:: set system ip arp table-size <number>

   Use this command to define the maximum number of entries to keep in
   the ARP cache (1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768).

.. cfgcmd:: set system ip multipath layer4-hashing

   Use this command to use Layer 4 information for IPv4 ECMP hashing.

Zebra/Kernel route filtering
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Zebra supports prefix-lists and Route Mapss to match routes received from
other FRR components. The permit/deny facilities provided by these commands
can be used to filter which routes zebra will install in the kernel.

.. cfgcmd:: set system ip protocol <protocol> route-map <route-map>

   Apply a route-map filter to routes for the specified protocol. The following
   protocols can be used: any, babel, bgp, connected, eigrp, isis, kernel,
   ospf, rip, static, table

   .. note:: If you choose any as the option that will cause all protocols that
      are sending routes to zebra.

Nexthop Tracking
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Nexthop tracking resolve nexthops via the default route by default. This is enabled
by default for a traditional profile of FRR which we use. It and can be disabled if
you do not wan't to e.g. allow BGP to peer across the default route.

.. cfgcmd:: set system ip nht no-resolve-via-default

   Do not allow IPv4 nexthop tracking to resolve via the default route. This
   parameter is configured per-VRF, so the command is also available in the VRF
   subnode.
