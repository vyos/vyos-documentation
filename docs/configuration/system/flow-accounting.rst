.. _flow-accounting:

NetFlow is a feature that was introduced on Cisco routers around 1996 that
provides the ability to collect IP network traffic as it enters or exits an
interface. By analyzing the data provided by NetFlow, a network administrator
can determine things such as the source and destination of traffic, class of
service, and the causes of congestion. A typical flow monitoring setup (using
NetFlow) consists of three main components:

* Flow exporter: aggregates packets into flows and exports flow records towards
  one or more flow collectors
* Flow collector: responsible for reception, storage and pre-processing of flow
  data received from a flow exporter
* Analysis application: analyzes received flow data in the context of intrusion
  detection or traffic profiling, for example

For connectionless protocols as like ICMP and UDP, a flow is considered complete
once no more packets for this flow appear after configurable timeout.

NetFlow is usually enabled on a per-interface basis to limit load on the router
components involved in NetFlow, or to limit the amount of NetFlow records
exported.

VyOS supports flow accounting through NetFlow (version 5, 9 and 10) or sFlow.

Flow Accounting
---------------

In order for flow accounting information to be collected and displayed for an
interface, the interface must be configured for flow accounting. The following
example shows how to configure ``eth0`` and ``bond3`` for flow accounting.

.. code-block:: none

  set system flow-accounting interface eth0
  set system flow-accounting interface bond3


NetFlow is a protocol originating from Cisco Systems. It works on level3.
VyOS supports version 5, 9 and 10 (IPFIX - IP Flow Information Export)

NetFlow v5 example:

.. code-block:: none

  set system flow-accounting netflow engine-id 100
  set system flow-accounting netflow version 5
  set system flow-accounting netflow server 192.168.2.10 port 2055

Displaying Flow Accounting Information
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Once flow accounting is configured on an interfaces it provides the ability to
display captured network traffic information for all configured interfaces.

The following op-mode command shows flow accounting for eth0.

.. code-block:: none

  vyos@vyos:~$ show flow-accounting interface eth0
  flow-accounting for [eth0]
