Route-Maps

Routing Policies could be used to tell the router (self or neighbors) what
routes and their attributes needs to be put into the routing table.

There could be a wide range of routing policies. Some examples are below:

* Permit or drop certain prefixes
* Set some metric to routes learned from a particular neighbor
* Set some attributes (like AS PATH or Community value) to advertised routes
  to neighbors
* Prefer a specific routing protocol routes over another routing protocol
  running on the same router

Example
=======

**Policy definition:**

.. code-block:: none

  # Create policy
  set policy route-map setmet rule 2 action 'permit'
  set policy route-map setmet rule 2 set as-path-prepend '2 2 2'

  # Apply policy to BGP
  set protocols bgp 1 neighbor 203.0.113.2 address-family ipv4-unicast route-map import 'setmet'
  set protocols bgp 1 neighbor 203.0.113.2 address-family ipv4-unicast soft-reconfiguration 'inbound'

Using 'soft-reconfiguration' we get the policy update without bouncing the
neighbor.

Routes learned before routing policy applied:
