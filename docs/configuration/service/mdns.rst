mDNS Repeater
-------------

Starting with VyOS 1.2 a `Multicast DNS`_ (mDNS) repeater functionality is
provided.

Multicast DNS uses the 224.0.0.51 address, which is "administratively scoped"
and does not leave the subnet. It re-broadcast mDNS packets from one interface
to other interfaces. This enables support for e.g. Apple Airplay devices across
multiple VLANs.

To enable mDNS repeater you need to configure at least two interfaces. To re-
broadcast all mDNS packets from `eth0` to `eth1` and vice versa run:

.. code-block:: none

  set service mdns repeater interface eth0
  set service mdns repeater interface eth1

mDNS repeater can be temporarily disabled without deleting the service using

.. code-block:: none

  set service mdns repeater disable

.. note:: You can not run this in a VRRP setup, if multiple mDNS repeaters
   are launched in a subnet you will experience the mDNS packet storm death!
