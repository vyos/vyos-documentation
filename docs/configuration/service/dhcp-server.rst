DHCP Server
###########

VyOS uses ISC DHCP server for both IPv4 and IPv6 address assignment.

***********
IPv4 server
***********

The network topology is declared by shared-network-name and the subnet
declarations. The DHCP service can serve multiple shared networks, with each
shared network having 1 or more subnets. Each subnet must be present on an
interface. A range can be declared inside a subnet to define a pool of dynamic
addresses. Multiple ranges can be defined and can contain holes. Static
mappings can be set to assign "static" addresses to clients based on their MAC
address.

Configuration
=============

.. cfgcmd:: set service dhcp-server hostfile-update

   Create DNS record per client lease, by adding clients to /etc/hosts file.
   Entry will have format: `<shared-network-name>_<hostname>.<domain-name>`

.. cfgcmd:: set service dhcp-server host-decl-name

   Will drop `<shared-network-name>_` from client DNS record, using only the
   host declaration name and domain: `<hostname>.<domain-name>`

.. cfgcmd:: set service dhcp-server shared-network-name <name> domain-name <domain-name>

   The domain-name parameter should be the domain name that will be appended to
   the client's hostname to form a fully-qualified domain-name (FQDN) (DHCP
   Option 015).

   This is the configuration parameter for the entire shared network definition.
   All subnets will inherit this configuration item if not specified locally.

.. cfgcmd:: set service dhcp-server shared-network-name <name> domain-search <domain-name>

   The domain-name parameter should be the domain name used when completing DNS
   request where no full FQDN is passed. This option can be given multiple times
   if you need multiple search domains (DHCP Option 119).

   This is the configuration parameter for the entire shared network definition.
   All subnets will inherit this configuration item if not specified locally.

.. cfgcmd:: set service dhcp-server shared-network-name <name> name-server <address>

   Inform client that the DNS server can be found at `<address>`.

   This is the configuration parameter for the entire shared network definition.
   All subnets will inherit this configuration item if not specified locally.

   Multiple DNS servers can be defined.

.. cfgcmd:: set service dhcp-server shared-network-name <name> ping-check

   When the DHCP server is considering dynamically allocating an IP address to a
   client, it first sends an ICMP Echo request (a ping) to the address being
   assigned. It waits for a second, and if no ICMP Echo response has been heard,
   it assigns the address.

   If a response is heard, the lease is abandoned, and the server does not
   respond to the client. The lease will remain abandoned for a minimum of
   abandon-lease-time seconds (defaults to 24 hours).

   If there are no free addresses but there are abandoned IP addresses, the
   DHCP server will attempt to reclaim an abandoned IP address regardless of the
   value of abandon-lease-time.

.. cfgcmd:: set service dhcp-server listen-address <address>

   This configuration parameter lets the DHCP server to listen for DHCP 
   requests sent to the specified address, it is only realistically useful for 
   a server whose only clients are reached via unicasts, such as via DHCP relay 
   agents.

Individual Client Subnet
-------------------------

.. cfgcmd:: set service dhcp-server shared-network-name <name> authoritative

   This says that this device is the only DHCP server for this network. If other
   devices are trying to offer DHCP leases, this machine will send 'DHCPNAK' to
   any device trying to request an IP address that is not valid for this
   network.

.. cfgcmd:: set service dhcp-server shared-network-name <name> subnet <subnet>
   default-router <address>

   This is a configuration parameter for the `<subnet>`, saying that as part of
   the response, tell the client that the default gateway can be reached at
   `<address>`.

.. cfgcmd:: set service dhcp-server shared-network-name <name> subnet <subnet>
   name-server <address>

   This is a configuration parameter for the subnet, saying that as part of the
   response, tell the client that the DNS server can be found at `<address>`.

   Multiple DNS servers can be defined.

.. cfgcmd:: set service dhcp-server shared-network-name <name> subnet <subnet>
   lease <time>

   Assign the IP address to this machine for `<time>` seconds.

   The default value is 86400 seconds which corresponds to one day.

.. cfgcmd:: set service dhcp-server shared-network-name <name> subnet <subnet>
   range <n> start <address>

   Create DHCP address range with a range id of `<n>`. DHCP leases are taken
   from this pool. The pool starts at address `<address>`.

.. cfgcmd:: set service dhcp-server shared-network-name <name> subnet <subnet>
   range <n> stop <address>

   Create DHCP address range with a range id of `<n>`. DHCP leases are taken
   from this pool. The pool stops with address `<address>`.

.. cfgcmd:: set service dhcp-server shared-network-name <name> subnet <subnet>
   exclude <address>

   Always exclude this address from any defined range. This address will never
   be assigned by the DHCP server.

   This option can be specified multiple times.

.. cfgcmd:: set service dhcp-server shared-network-name <name> subnet <subnet>
   domain-name <domain-name>

   The domain-name parameter should be the domain name that will be appended to
   the client's hostname to form a fully-qualified domain-name (FQDN) (DHCP
   Option 015).

.. cfgcmd:: set service dhcp-server shared-network-name <name> subnet <subnet>
   domain-search <domain-name>

   The domain-name parameter should be the domain name used when completing DNS
   request where no full FQDN is passed. This option can be given multiple times
   if you need multiple search domains (DHCP Option 119).

.. cfgcmd:: set service dhcp-server shared-network-name <name> subnet <subnet>
   ping-check

   When the DHCP server is considering dynamically allocating an IP address to a
   client, it first sends an ICMP Echo request (a ping) to the address being
   assigned. It waits for a second, and if no ICMP Echo response has been heard,
   it assigns the address.

   If a response is heard, the lease is abandoned, and the server does not
   respond to the client. The lease will remain abandoned for a minimum of
   abandon-lease-time seconds (defaults to 24 hours).

   If a there are no free addresses but there are abandoned IP addresses, the
   DHCP server will attempt to reclaim an abandoned IP address regardless of the
   value of abandon-lease-time.

.. cfgcmd:: set service dhcp-server shared-network-name <name> subnet <subnet>
   enable-failover

   Enable DHCP failover configuration for this address pool.

Failover
--------

VyOS provides support for DHCP failover. DHCP failover must be configured
explicitly by the following statements.

.. cfgcmd:: set service dhcp-server failover source-address <address>

   Local IP `<address>` used when communicating to the failover peer.

.. cfgcmd:: set service dhcp-server failover remote <address>

   Remote peer IP `<address>` of the second DHCP server in this failover
   cluster.

.. cfgcmd:: set service dhcp-server failover name <name>

   A generic `<name>` referencing this sync service.

   .. note:: `<name>` must be identical on both sides!

.. cfgcmd:: set service dhcp-server failover status <primary | secondary>

   The primary and secondary statements determines whether the server is primary
   or secondary.

   .. note:: In order for the primary and the secondary DHCP server to keep
      their lease tables in sync, they must be able to reach each other on TCP
      port 647. If you have firewall rules in effect, adjust them accordingly.

   .. hint:: The dialogue between failover partners is neither encrypted nor
      authenticated. Since most DHCP servers exist within an organisation's own
      secure Intranet, this would be an unnecessary overhead. However, if you
      have DHCP failover peers whose communications traverse insecure networks,
      then we recommend that you consider the use of VPN tunneling between them
      to ensure that the failover partnership is immune to disruption
      (accidental or otherwise) via third parties.

Static mappings
---------------

You can specify a static DHCP assignment on a per host basis. You will need the
MAC address of the station and your desired IP address. The address must be
inside the subnet definition but can be outside of the range statement.

.. cfgcmd:: set service dhcp-server shared-network-name <name> subnet
   <subnet> static-mapping <description> mac-address <address>

   Create a new DHCP static mapping named `<description>` which is valid for
   the host identified by its MAC `<address>`.

.. cfgcmd:: set service dhcp-server shared-network-name <name> subnet
   <subnet> static-mapping <description> ip-address <address>

   Static DHCP IP address assign to host identified by `<description>`. IP
   address must be inside the `<subnet>` which is defined but can be outside
   the dynamic range created with :cfgcmd:`set service dhcp-server
   shared-network-name <name> subnet <subnet> range <n>`. If no ip-address is
   specified, an IP from the dynamic pool is used.

   This is useful, for example, in combination with hostfile update.

   .. hint:: This is the equivalent of the host block in dhcpd.conf of
      isc-dhcpd.

**Example:**

* IP address ``192.168.1.100`` shall be statically mapped to client named ``client1``

.. code-block:: none

  set service dhcp-server shared-network-name 'NET1' subnet 192.168.1.0/24 static-mapping client1 ip-address 192.168.1.100
  set service dhcp-server shared-network-name 'NET1' subnet 192.168.1.0/24 static-mapping client1 mac-address aa:bb:11:22:33:00

The configuration will look as follows:

.. code-block:: none

  show service dhcp-server shared-network-name NET1
   subnet 192.168.1.0/24 {
       static-mapping client1 {
           ip-address 192.168.1.100
           mac-address aa:bb:11:22:33:00
       }
   }

Raw Parameters
==============

Raw parameters can be passed to shared-network-name, subnet and static-mapping:

.. code-block:: none

  set service dhcp-server shared-network-name <name> shared-network-parameters
     <text>       Additional shared-network parameters for DHCP server.
  set service dhcp-server shared-network-name <name> subnet <subnet> subnet-parameters
     <text>       Additional subnet parameters for DHCP server.
  set service dhcp-server shared-network-name <name> subnet <subnet> static-mapping <description> static-mapping-parameters
     <text>       Additional static-mapping parameters for DHCP server.
                  Will be placed inside the "host" block of the mapping.

These parameters are passed as-is to isc-dhcp's dhcpd.conf under the
configuration node they are defined in. They are not validated so an error in
the raw parameters won't be caught by vyos's scripts and will cause dhcpd to
fail to start. Always verify that the parameters are correct before committing
the configuration. Refer to isc-dhcp's dhcpd.conf manual for more information:
https://kb.isc.org/docs/isc-dhcp-44-manual-pages-dhcpdconf

Quotes can be used inside parameter values by replacing all quote characters
with the string ``&quot;``. They will be replaced with literal quote characters
when generating dhcpd.conf.

Example
=======

Please see the :ref:`dhcp-dns-quick-start` configuration.

.. _dhcp-server:v4_example_failover:

Failover
--------

Configuration of a DHCP failover pair

Raw Parameters
--------------

* Override static-mapping's name-server with a custom one that will be sent only
  to this host.
* An option that takes a quoted string is set by replacing all quote characters
  with the string ``&quot;`` inside the static-mapping-parameters value.
  The resulting line in dhcpd.conf will be
  ``option pxelinux.configfile "pxelinux.cfg/01-00-15-17-44-2d-aa";``.


.. code-block:: none

  set service dhcp-server shared-network-name dhcpexample subnet 192.0.2.0/24 static-mapping example static-mapping-parameters "option domain-name-servers 192.0.2.11, 192.0.2.12;"

***********
IPv6 server
***********

VyOS also provides DHCPv6 server functionality which is described in this
section.

.. _dhcp-server:v6_config:

Configuration
=============

.. cfgcmd:: set service dhcpv6-server preference <preference value>

   Clients receiving advertise messages from multiple servers choose the server
   with the highest preference value. The range for this value is ``0...255``.

.. cfgcmd:: set service dhcpv6-server shared-network-name <name> subnet
   <prefix> lease-time {default | maximum | minimum}

   The default lease time for DHCPv6 leases is 24 hours. This can be changed by
   supplying a ``default-time``, ``maximum-time`` and ``minimum-time``. All
   values need to be supplied in seconds.

.. cfgcmd:: set service dhcpv6-server shared-network-name <name> subnet
   <prefix> nis-domain <domain-name>

   A :abbr:`NIS (Network Information Service)` domain can be set to be used for
   DHCPv6 clients.

.. cfgcmd:: set service dhcpv6-server shared-network-name <name> subnet
   <prefix> nisplus-domain <domain-name>

   The procedure to specify a :abbr:`NIS+ (Network Information Service Plus)`
   domain is similar to the NIS domain one:

.. cfgcmd:: set service dhcpv6-server shared-network-name <name> subnet
   <prefix> nis-server <address>

   Specify a NIS server address for DHCPv6 clients.

.. cfgcmd:: set service dhcpv6-server shared-network-name <name> subnet
   <prefix> nisplus-server <address>

   Specify a NIS+ server address for DHCPv6 clients.

.. cfgcmd:: set service dhcpv6-server shared-network-name <name> subnet
   <prefix> sip-server <address | fqdn>

   Specify a :abbr:`SIP (Session Initiation Protocol)` server by IPv6
   address of Fully Qualified Domain Name for all DHCPv6 clients.

.. cfgcmd:: set service dhcpv6-server shared-network-name <name> subnet
   <prefix> sntp-server-address <address>

   A SNTP server address can be specified for DHCPv6 clients.

Prefix Delegation
-----------------

To hand out individual prefixes to your clients the following configuration is
used:


.. cfgcmd:: set service dhcpv6-server shared-network-name <name> subnet
   <prefix> prefix-delegation start <address> prefix-length <length>

   Hand out prefixes of size `<length>` to clients in subnet `<prefix>` when
   they request for prefix delegation.

.. cfgcmd:: set service dhcpv6-server shared-network-name <name> subnet
   <prefix> prefix-delegation start <address> stop <address>

   Delegate prefixes from the range indicated by the start and stop qualifier.

Address pools
-------------

DHCPv6 address pools must be configured for the system to act as a DHCPv6
server. The following example describes a common scenario.

**Example:**

* A shared network named ``NET1`` serves subnet ``2001:db8::/64``
* It is connected to ``eth1``
* DNS server is located at ``2001:db8::ffff``
* Address pool shall be ``2001:db8::100`` through ``2001:db8::199``.
* Lease time will be left at the default value which is 24 hours

.. code-block:: none

  set service dhcpv6-server shared-network-name 'NET1' subnet 2001:db8::/64 address-range start 2001:db8::100 stop 2001:db8::199
  set service dhcpv6-server shared-network-name 'NET1' subnet 2001:db8::/64 name-server 2001:db8::ffff

The configuration will look as follows:

.. code-block:: none

  show service dhcpv6-server
      shared-network-name NET1 {
          subnet 2001:db8::/64 {
             address-range {
                start 2001:db8::100 {
                   stop 2001:db8::199
                }
             }
             name-server 2001:db8::ffff
          }
      }

.. _dhcp-server:v6_static_mapping:

Static mappings
---------------

In order to map specific IPv6 addresses to specific hosts static mappings can
be created. The following example explains the process.

**Example:**

* IPv6 address ``2001:db8::101`` shall be statically mapped
* IPv6 prefix ``2001:db8:0:101::/64`` shall be statically mapped
* Host specific mapping shall be named ``client1``

.. hint:: The identifier is the device's DUID: colon-separated hex list (as
   used by isc-dhcp option dhcpv6.client-id). If the device already has a
   dynamic lease from the DHCPv6 server, its DUID can be found with ``show
   service dhcpv6 server leases``. The DUID begins at the 5th octet (after the
