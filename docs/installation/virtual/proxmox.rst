Running on Proxmox
******************

Proxmox is an open-source platform for virtualization. Please visit
https://vyos.io to see how to get a qcow2 image that can be imported
into Proxmox.

Deploy VyOS from CLI with qcow2 image
=====================================

1. Copy the qcow2 image to a temporary directory on the Proxmox server.
2. The commands below assume that virtual machine ID 200 is unused and that the user wants the disk stored in a storage pool called `local-lvm`.

.. code-block:: none

  $ qm create 200 --name vyos2 --memory 2048 --net0 virtio,bridge=vmbr0
  $ qm importdisk 200 /path/to/image/vyos-1.2.8-proxmox-2G.qcow2 local-lvm
  $ qm set 200 --virtio0 local-lvm:vm-200-disk-0
  $ qm set 200 --boot order=virtio0

3. Optionally, the user can attach a CDROM with an ISO as a cloud-init data source. The below command assumes the ISO has been uploaded to the `local` storage pool with the name `seed.iso`.

.. code-block:: none

  $ qm set 200 --ide2 media=cdrom,file=local:iso/seed.iso

4. Start the virtual machine in the proxmox GUI or CLI using ``qm start 200``.



Deploy VyOS from CLI with rolling release ISO
=============================================

1. Download the rolling release iso from https://vyos.net/get/nightly-builds/. Non-subscribers will have a small window of opportunity to build the latest LTS release from source when the LTS tags are created, otherwise they will only be able to build rolling releases from the source LTS branch. Instructions can be found in the :ref:`build` section of this manual. VyOS source code repository is available https://github.com/vyos/vyos-build.
2. Prepare VM for installation from ISO media. The commands below assume that your iso is available in a storage pool 'local', that you want it to have a VM ID '200' and want to create a new disk on storage pool 'local-lvm' of size 15GB.

.. code-block:: none

  qm create 200 --name vyos --memory 2048 --net0 virtio,bridge=vmbr0 --ide2 media=cdrom,file=local:iso/live-image-amd64.hybrid.iso --virtio0 local-lvm:15

3. Start the VM using the command ``qm start 200`` or using the start button located in the proxmox GUI.
4. Using the proxmox webGUI, open the virtual console for your newly created vm. Login username/password is ``vyos/vyos``.
5. Once booted into the live system, type ``install image`` into the command line and follow the prompts to install VyOS to the virtual drive.
6. After installation has completed, remove the installation iso using the GUI or ``qm set 200 --ide2 none``.
7. Reboot the virtual machine using the GUI or ``qm reboot 200``.
