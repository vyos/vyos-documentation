############
Installation
############

VyOS installation requires to download a VyOS .iso file. That file is
a live install image that lets you boot a live VyOS. From that live
system you can proceed to the permanent installation on a hard drive or
any other type of storage.


Hardware requirements
=====================

The minimum system requirements are 512 MiB RAM and 2 GiB storage.
Depending on your use you might need additional RAM and CPU resources e.g.
when having multiple BGP full tables in your system.

Download
========

Registered Subscribers
----------------------

Registered subscribers can log into https://support.vyos.io/ to have access to
a variety of different downloads via the "Downloads" link. These downloads
include LTS (Long-Term-Support) and associated hot-fix releases, early public
access releases, pre-built VM images, as well as device specific installation
ISOs.

.. figure:: /_static/images/vyos-downloads.png

Building from source
----------------------

Non-subscribers can always get the LTS release by building it from source.
Instruction can be found in the :ref:`build` section of this manual. VyOS
source code repository is available for everyone at
https://github.com/vyos/vyos-build.

Rolling Release
---------------

Everyone can download bleeding-edge VyOS rolling images from:
https://downloads.vyos.io/

.. note:: Rolling releases contain all the latest enhancements and fixes. This
   means that there will be new bugs of course. If you think you hit a bug
   please follow the guide at :ref:`issues_features`. To improve VyOS we depend on
   your feedback!

The following link will always fetch the most recent VyOS build for AMD64
systems from the current branch:
https://downloads.vyos.io/rolling/current/amd64/vyos-rolling-latest.iso


Download Verification
---------------------

LTS images are signed by VyOS lead package-maintainer private key. With
the official public key, the authenticity of the package can be
verified. :abbr:`GPG (GNU Privacy Guard)` is used for verification.

.. note:: This subsection only applies e applies to LTS images, for
   Rolling images please jump to :ref:`live_installation`.

Preparing for the verification
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

First, install GPG or another OpenPGP implementation. On most GNU+Linux
distributions it is installed by default as package managers use it to
verify package signatures. If not pre-installed, it will need to be
downloaded and installed.

The official VyOS public key can be retrieved in a number of ways. Skip
to :ref:`gpg-verification` if the key is already present.

It can be retrieved directly from a key server:

``gpg --recv-keys FD220285A0FE6D7E``

Or it can be accessed via a web browser:

https://pgp.mit.edu/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0xFD220285A0FE6D7E

Or from the following block:

.. _live_installation:

Live installation
=================

.. note:: A permanent VyOS installation always requires to go first
   through a live installation.

VyOS, as other GNU+Linux distributions, can be tasted without installing
it in your hard drive. **With your downloaded VyOS .iso file you can
create a bootable USB drive that will let you boot into a fully
functional VyOS system**. Once you have tested it, you can either decide
to begin a :ref:`permanent_installation` in your hard drive or power
your system off, remove the USB drive, and leave everythng as it was. 


If you have a GNU+Linux system, you can create your VyOS bootable USB
stick with with the ``dd`` command:

 1. Open your terminal emulator.

 2. Find out the device name of your USB drive (you can use the ``lsblk``
    command)

 3. Unmount the USB drive. Replace X in the example below with the
    letter of your device and keep the asterisk (wildcard) to unmount
    all partitions.

 .. code-block:: none
 
  $ umount /dev/sdX* 

 4. Write the image (your VyOS .iso file) to the USB drive.
    Note that here you want to use the device name (e.g. /dev/sdb), not
    the partition name (e.g. /dev/sdb1).

  **Warning**: This will destroy all data on the USB drive!

 .. code-block:: none
 
   # dd if=/path/to/vyos.iso of=/dev/sdX bs=8M; sync

 5. Wait until you get the outcome (bytes copied). Be patient, in some
    computers it might take more than one minute.

 6. Once ``dd`` has finished, pull the USB drive out and plug it into
    the powered-off computer where you want to install (or test) VyOS.

 7. Power the computer on, making sure it boots from the USB drive (you
    might need to select booting device or change booting settings).

 8. Once VyOS is completely loaded, enter the default credentials
    (login: vyos, password: vyos).


If you find difficulties with this method, prefer to use a GUI program,
or have a different operating system, there are other programs you can
use to create a bootable USB drive, like balenaEtcher_ (for GNU/Linux,
macOS and Windows), Rufus_ (for Windows) and `many others`_. You can
follow their instructions to create a bootable USB drive from an .iso
file.

.. hint:: The default username and password for the live system is *vyos*.


.. _permanent_installation:

Permanent installation
======================

.. note:: Before a permanent installation, VyOS requires a :ref:`live_installation`.

Unlike general purpose Linux distributions, VyOS uses "image installation" that
mimics the user experience of traditional hardware routers and allows keeping
multiple VyOS versions installed simultaneously. This makes it possible to
switch to a previous version if something breaks or miss-behaves after an image
upgrade.

Every version is contained in its own squashfs image that is mounted in a union
filesystem together with a directory for mutable data such as configurations,
keys, or custom scripts.

.. note:: Older versions (prior to VyOS 1.1) used to support non-image
   installation (``install system`` command). Support for this has been removed
   from VyOS 1.2 and newer releases. Older releases can still be upgraded via
   the general ``add system image <image_path>`` upgrade command (consult
   :ref:`image-mgmt` for further information).


In order to proceed with a permanent installation:

 1. Log into the VyOS live system (use the default credentials: vyos,
    vyos)

 2. Run the ``install image`` command and follow the wizard:

 .. code-block:: none

   vyos@vyos:~$ install image
   Welcome to the VyOS install program.  This script
   will walk you through the process of installing the
   VyOS image to a local hard drive.
   Would you like to continue? (Yes/No) [Yes]: Yes
   Probing drives: OK
   Looking for pre-existing RAID groups...none found.
   The VyOS image will require a minimum 2000MB root.
   Would you like me to try to partition a drive automatically
   or would you rather partition it manually with parted?  If
   you have already setup your partitions, you may skip this step
   
   Partition (Auto/Parted/Skip) [Auto]:
   
   I found the following drives on your system:

   Done!


 3. After the installation is complete, remove the live USB stick or
    CD.

 4. Reboot the system.

 .. code-block:: none

  vyos@vyos:~$ reboot
  Proceed with reboot? (Yes/No) [No] Yes

 You will boot now into a permanent VyOS system.


PXE Boot
========

VyOS can also be installed through PXE. This is a more complex
installation method which allows deploying VyOS through the network.

**Requirements**

* Clients (where VyOS is to be installed) with a PXE-enabled NIC
* DHCP Server 
* TFTP Server
* Webserver (HTTP) - optional, but we will use it to speed up installation
* VyOS ISO image to be installed (do not use images prior to VyOS 1.2.3)
* Files *pxelinux.0* and *ldlinux.c32* `from the Syslinux distribution <https://kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/boot/syslinux/>`_

Configuration
-------------

Step 1: DHCP
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Configure a DHCP server to provide the client with:

* An IP address
* The TFTP server address (DHCP option 66). Sometimes referred as *boot server*
* The *bootfile name* (DHCP option 67), which is *pxelinux.0*

In this example we configured an existent VyOS as the DHCP server:

.. code-block:: none

  vyos@vyos# show service dhcp-server
   shared-network-name mydhcp {
       subnet 192.168.1.0/24 {
           bootfile-name pxelinux.0
           bootfile-server 192.168.1.50
           default-router 192.168.1.50
           range 0 {
               start 192.168.1.70
               stop 192.168.1.100
           }
       }
   }

.. _install_from_tftp:

Step 2: TFTP
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Configure a TFTP server so that it serves the following:

* The *pxelinux.0* file from the Syslinux distribution
* The *ldlinux.c32* file from the Syslinux distribution
* The kernel of the VyOS software you want to deploy. That is the
  *vmlinuz* file inside the */live* directory of the extracted
  contents from the ISO file.
* The initial ramdisk of the VyOS ISO you want to deploy. That is the
  *initrd.img* file inside the */live* directory of the extracted
  contents from the ISO file. Do not use an empty (0 bytes) initrd.img
  file you might find, the correct file may have a longer name.
* A directory named pxelinux.cfg which must contain the configuration
  file. We will use the configuration_ file shown below, which we named
  default_.

.. _configuration: https://wiki.syslinux.org/wiki/index.php?title=Config
.. _default: https://wiki.syslinux.org/wiki/index.php?title=PXELINUX#Configuration

In the example we configured our existent VyOS as the TFTP server too:

.. code-block:: none

  vyos@vyos# show service tftp-server
   directory /config/tftpboot
   listen-address 192.168.1.50

Example of the contents of the TFTP server:

.. code-block:: none

  vyos@vyos# ls -hal /config/tftpboot/
  total 29M
  drwxr-sr-x 3 tftp tftp      4.0K Oct 14 00:23 .
  drwxrwsr-x 9 root vyattacfg 4.0K Oct 18 00:05 ..
  -r--r--r-- 1 root vyattacfg  25M Oct 13 23:24 initrd.img-4.19.54-amd64-vyos
  -rwxr-xr-x 1 root vyattacfg 120K Oct 13 23:44 ldlinux.c32
  -rw-r--r-- 1 root vyattacfg  46K Oct 13 23:24 pxelinux.0
  drwxr-xr-x 2 root vyattacfg 4.0K Oct 14 01:10 pxelinux.cfg
  -r--r--r-- 1 root vyattacfg 3.7M Oct 13 23:24 vmlinuz

  vyos@vyos# ls -hal /config/tftpboot/pxelinux.cfg
  total 12K
  drwxr-xr-x 2 root vyattacfg 4.0K Oct 14 01:10 .
  drwxr-sr-x 3 tftp tftp      4.0K Oct 14 00:23 ..
  -rw-r--r-- 1 root root       191 Oct 14 01:10 default

Example of simple (no menu) configuration file:

.. code-block:: none

  vyos@vyos# cat /config/tftpboot/pxelinux.cfg/default
  DEFAULT VyOS123

  LABEL VyOS123
   KERNEL vmlinuz
   APPEND initrd=initrd.img-4.19.54-amd64-vyos boot=live nopersistence noautologin nonetworking fetch=http://address:8000/filesystem.squashfs

Step 3: HTTP
^^^^^^^^^^^^

We also need to provide the *filesystem.squashfs* file. That is a heavy
file and TFTP is slow, so you could send it through HTTP to speed up the
transfer. That is how it is done in our example, you can find that in
the configuration file above.

**First** run a web server - you can use a simple one like
`Python's SimpleHTTPServer`_ and start serving the `filesystem.squashfs`
file. The file can be found inside the `/live` directory of the
extracted contents of the ISO file.

**Second**, edit the configuration file of the :ref:`install_from_tftp`
so that it shows the correct URL at
``fetch=http://<address_of_your_HTTP_server>/filesystem.squashfs``.

.. note:: Do not change the name of the *filesystem.squashfs* file. If 
   you are working with different versions, you can create different
   directories instead.

And **third**, restart the TFTP service. If you are using VyOS as your
TFTP Server, you can restart the service with
``sudo service tftpd-hpa restart``.

.. note::  Make sure the available directories and files in both TFTP
   and HTTP server have the right permissions to be accessed from the
   booting clients.

.. _`Python's SimpleHTTPServer`: https://docs.python.org/2/library/simplehttpserver.html

Client Boot
-----------

Finally, turn on your PXE-enabled client or clients. They will
automatically get an IP address from the DHCP server and start booting
into VyOS live from the files automatically taken from the TFTP and HTTP
servers.

Once finished you will be able to proceed with the ``install image``
command as in a regular VyOS installation.



Known Issues
============

This is a list of known issues that can arise during installation.

Black screen on install
-----------------------

GRUB attempts to redirect all output to a serial port for ease of installation on headless hosts.
This appears to cause an hard lockup on some hardware that lacks a serial port, with the result being a 
black screen after selecting the `Live system` option from the installation image.

The workaround is to type `e` when the boot menu appears and edit the GRUB boot options.  Specifically, remove the:

`console=ttyS0,115200` 

option, and type CTRL-X to boot. 

Installation can then continue as outlined above.
