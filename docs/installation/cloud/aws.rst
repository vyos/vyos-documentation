Deploy VM
---------

Deploy VyOS on Amazon :abbr:`AWS (Amazon Web Services)`

1. Click to ``Instances`` and ``Launch Instance``

.. figure:: /_static/images/cloud-aws-01.png

2. On the marketplace search "VyOS"

.. figure:: /_static/images/cloud-aws-02.png

3. Choose the instance type. Minimum recommendation start from ``m3.medium``

.. figure:: /_static/images/cloud-aws-03.png

4. Configure instance for your requirements. Select number of
   instances / network / subnet

.. figure:: /_static/images/cloud-aws-04.png

5. Additional storage. You can remove additional storage ``/dev/sdb``. First
   root device will be ``/dev/xvda``. You can skip this step.

6. Configure Security Group. It's recommended that you configure ssh access
   only from certain address sources. Or permit any (by default).

.. figure:: /_static/images/cloud-aws-06.png

7. Select SSH key pair and click ``Launch Instances``

.. figure:: /_static/images/cloud-aws-07.png

8. Find out your public IP address.

.. figure:: /_static/images/cloud-aws-08.png

9. Connect to the instance by SSH key.

  .. code-block:: none

    ssh -i ~/.ssh/amazon.pem vyos@203.0.113.3
    vyos@ip-192-0-2-10:~$

Amazon CloudWatch Agent Usage
-----------------------------

To use Amazon CloudWatch Agent, configure it within the Amazon SSM Parameter Store. If you don't have a configuration yet, do :ref:`configuration_creation`.

1. Create an :abbr:`IAM (Identity and Access Management)` role for the :abbr:`EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)` instance to access CloudWatch service, and name it CloudWatchAgentServerRole. The role should contain two default policies: CloudWatchAgentServerPolicy and AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore.  

2. Attach the created role to your VyOS :abbr:`EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)` instance.

3. Ensure that amazon-cloudwatch-agent package is installed. 

  .. code-block:: none

    $ sudo apt list --installed | grep amazon-cloudwatch-agent

  .. note:: The amazon-cloudwatch-agent package is normally included in VyOS 1.3.3+ and 1.4+

3. Retrieve an existing CloudWatch Agent configuration from the :abbr:`SSM (Systems Manager)` Parameter Store.

  .. code-block:: none

    $ sudo /opt/aws/amazon-cloudwatch-agent/bin/amazon-cloudwatch-agent-ctl -a fetch-config -m ec2 -s -c ssm:<your-configuration-name>

  This step also enables systemd service and runs it.

  .. note:: The VyOS platform-specific scripts feature is under development. Thus, this step should be repeated manually after changing system image (:doc:`/installation/update`)

.. _configuration_creation:

CloudWatch SSM Configuration creation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Creating the Amazon Cloudwatch Agent Configuration in Amazon :abbr:`SSM (Systems Manager)` Parameter Store.

1. Create an :abbr:`IAM (Identity and Access Management)` role for your :abbr:`EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)` instance to access the CloudWatch service. Name it CloudWatchAgentAdminRole. The role should contain at two default policies: CloudWatchAgentAdminPolicy and AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore.  

  .. note:: CloudWatchAgentServerRole is too permissive and should be used for single configuration creation and deployment. That's why after completion of step #3 highly recommended to replace instance CloudWatchAgentAdminRole role with CloudWatchAgentServerRole.

2. Run Cloudwatch configuration wizard.

  .. code-block:: none

    $ sudo /opt/aws/amazon-cloudwatch-agent/bin/amazon-cloudwatch-agent-config-wizard

3. When prompted, answer "yes" to the question "Do you want to store the config in the SSM parameter store?".
