Build VyOS
##########

*************
Prerequisites
*************

There are different ways you can build VyOS.

Building using a :ref:`build_docker` container, although not the only way,
is the easiest way as all dependencies are managed for you. However, you can
also set up your own build machine and run a :ref:`build_native`.

.. note:: Starting with VyOS 1.2 the release model of VyOS has changed. VyOS
   is now **free as in speech, but not as in beer**. This means that while
   VyOS is still an open source project, the release ISOs are no longer free
   and can only be obtained via subscription, or by contributing to the
   community.

   The source code remains public and an ISO can be built using the process
   outlined in this chapter.

   The following includes the build process for VyOS 1.2 to the latest version.

This will guide you through the process of building a VyOS ISO using Docker_.
This process has been tested on clean installs of Debian Jessie, Stretch, and
Buster.

.. _build_native:

Native Build
============

To build VyOS natively you require a properly configured build host with the
following Debian versions installed:

- Debian Jessie for VyOS 1.2 (crux)
- Debian Buster for VyOS 1.3 (equuleus) 
- Debian Bookworm for VyOS 1.4 (sagitta)
- Debian Bookworm for the upcoming VyOS 1.5/circinus/current 
  (subject to change) - aka the rolling release

To start, clone the repository to your local machine:

.. code-block:: none

  # For VyOS 1.2 (crux)
  $ git clone -b crux --single-branch https://github.com/vyos/vyos-build

  # For VyOS 1.3 (equuleus)
  $ git clone -b equuleus --single-branch https://github.com/vyos/vyos-build

  # For VyOS 1.4 (sagitta)
  $ git clone -b sagitta --single-branch https://github.com/vyos/vyos-build

  # For VyOS 1.5 (circinus,current)
  $ git clone -b current --single-branch https://github.com/vyos/vyos-build

  $ cd vyos-build

  # For VyOS 1.2 (crux) and VyOS 1.3 (equuleus)
  $ ./configure --architecture amd64 --build-by "j.randomhacker@vyos.io"
  $ sudo make iso

  # For VyOS 1.4 (sagitta) and VyOS 1.5 (circinus,current)
  $ sudo make clean
  $ sudo ./build-vyos-image iso --architecture amd64 --build-by "j.randomhacker@vyos.io"

For the packages required, you can refer to the ``docker/Dockerfile`` file
in the repository_. The ``./build-vyos-image`` script will also warn you if any
dependencies are missing.

This will guide you through the process of building a VyOS ISO using Docker. 
This process has been tested on clean installs of Debian Bullseye (11) and 
Bookworm (12).

.. _build_docker:

Docker
======

Installing Docker_ and prerequisites:

.. hint:: Due to the updated version of Docker, the following examples may 
   become invalid.

.. code-block:: none

  # Add Docker's official GPG key:
  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get install ca-certificates curl gnupg
  sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings
  curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/debian/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg
  sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg

  # Add the repository to Apt sources:
  echo \
    "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/debian \
    $(. /etc/os-release && echo "$VERSION_CODENAME") stable" | \
    sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null

  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin

To be able to use Docker_ without ``sudo``, the current non-root user must be
added to the ``docker`` group by calling: ``sudo usermod -aG docker
yourusername``.

.. hint:: Doing so grants privileges equivalent to the ``root`` user! It is
   recommended to remove the non-root user from the ``docker`` group after
   building the VyOS ISO. See also `Docker as non-root`_.

.. note:: The build process needs to be built on a local file system, building
   on SMB or NFS shares will result in the container failing to build properly!
   VirtualBox Drive Share is also not an option as block device operations
   are not implemented and the drive is always mounted as "nodev"

Build Container
---------------

The container can be built by hand or by fetching the pre-built one from
DockerHub. Using the pre-built containers from the `VyOS DockerHub
organisation`_ will ensure that the container is always up-to-date. A rebuild
is triggered once the container changes (please note this will take 2-3 hours
after pushing to the vyos-build repository).

.. note: If you are using the pre-built container, it will be automatically
   downloaded from DockerHub if it is not found on your local machine when
   you build the ISO.

Dockerhub
^^^^^^^^^

To manually download the container from DockerHub, run:

.. code-block:: none

  $ docker pull vyos/vyos-build:crux     # For VyOS 1.2
  $ docker pull vyos/vyos-build:equuleus # For VyOS 1.3
  $ docker pull vyos/vyos-build:sagitta  # For VyOS 1.4
  $ docker pull vyos/vyos-build:current  # For VyOS 1.5 rolling release

Build from source
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The container can also be built directly from source:

.. code-block:: none

  # For VyOS 1.2 (crux)
  $ git clone -b crux --single-branch https://github.com/vyos/vyos-build
  # For VyOS 1.3 (equuleus)
  $ git clone -b equuleus --single-branch https://github.com/vyos/vyos-build
  # For VyOS 1.4 (sagitta)
  $ git clone -b sagitta --single-branch https://github.com/vyos/vyos-build
  # For VyOS 1.5 (circinus,current)
  $ git clone -b current --single-branch https://github.com/vyos/vyos-build
  
  $ cd vyos-build
  $ docker build -t vyos/vyos-build:crux docker           # For VyOS 1.2
  $ docker build -t vyos/vyos-build:equuleus docker       # For VyOS 1.3
  $ docker build -t vyos/vyos-build:sagitta docker        # For VyOS 1.4
  $ docker build -t vyos/vyos-build:current docker        # For VyOS 1.5 rolling release

.. note:: VyOS has switched to Debian (12) Bookworm in its ``current`` branch,
   Due to software version updates, it is recommended to use the official 
   Docker Hub image to build VyOS ISO.
   
Tips and Tricks
---------------

You can create yourself some handy Bash aliases to always launch the latest -
per release train (`current` or `crux`) - container. Add the following to your
``.bash_aliases`` file:

.. code-block:: none

  alias vybld='docker pull vyos/vyos-build:current && docker run --rm -it \
      -v "$(pwd)":/vyos \
      -v "$HOME/.gitconfig":/etc/gitconfig \
      -v "$HOME/.bash_aliases":/home/vyos_bld/.bash_aliases \
      -v "$HOME/.bashrc":/home/vyos_bld/.bashrc \
      -w /vyos --privileged --sysctl net.ipv6.conf.lo.disable_ipv6=0 \
      -e GOSU_UID=$(id -u) -e GOSU_GID=$(id -g) \
      vyos/vyos-build:current bash'

  alias vybld_crux='docker pull vyos/vyos-build:crux && docker run --rm -it \
      -v "$(pwd)":/vyos \
      -v "$HOME/.gitconfig":/etc/gitconfig \
      -v "$HOME/.bash_aliases":/home/vyos_bld/.bash_aliases \
      -v "$HOME/.bashrc":/home/vyos_bld/.bashrc \
      -w /vyos --privileged --sysctl net.ipv6.conf.lo.disable_ipv6=0 \
      -e GOSU_UID=$(id -u) -e GOSU_GID=$(id -g) \
      vyos/vyos-build:crux bash'

Now you are prepared with two new aliases ``vybld`` and ``vybld_crux`` to spawn
your development containers in your current working directory.

.. note:: Some VyOS packages (namely vyos-1x) come with build-time tests which
   verify some of the internal library calls that they work as expected. Those
   tests are carried out through the Python Unittest module. If you want to
   build the ``vyos-1x`` package (which is our main development package) you
   need to start your Docker container using the following argument:
   ``--sysctl net.ipv6.conf.lo.disable_ipv6=0``, otherwise those tests will
   fail.


.. _build_iso:

*********
Build ISO
*********

Now as you are aware of the prerequisites we can continue and build our own
ISO from source. For this we have to fetch the latest source code from GitHub.
Please note as this will differ for both `current` and `crux`.

.. code-block:: none

  # For VyOS 1.2 (crux)
  $ git clone -b crux --single-branch https://github.com/vyos/vyos-build

  # For VyOS 1.3 (equuleus)
  $ git clone -b equuleus --single-branch https://github.com/vyos/vyos-build

  # For VyOS 1.4 (sagitta)
  $ git clone -b sagitta --single-branch https://github.com/vyos/vyos-build

  # For VyOS 1.5 (circinus,current)
  $ git clone -b current --single-branch https://github.com/vyos/vyos-build


Now a fresh build of the VyOS ISO can begin. Change directory to the
``vyos-build`` directory and run:

.. code-block:: none

  $ cd vyos-build
  # For VyOS 1.2 (crux)
  $ docker run --rm -it --privileged -v $(pwd):/vyos -w /vyos vyos/vyos-build:crux bash

  # For VyOS 1.3 (equuleus)
  $ docker run --rm -it --privileged -v $(pwd):/vyos -w /vyos vyos/vyos-build:equuleus bash

  # For VyOS 1.4 (sagitta)
  $ docker run --rm -it --privileged -v $(pwd):/vyos -w /vyos vyos/vyos-build:sagitta bash

  # For VyOS 1.5 (current)
  $ docker run --rm -it --privileged -v $(pwd):/vyos -w /vyos vyos/vyos-build:current bash
    
.. code-block:: none

  # For MacOS (crux, equuleus, sagitta)
  $ git clone https://github.com/vyos/vyos-utils-misc
  $ cd build-tools/macos-build

  # For VyOS 1.2 (crux)
  $ os=jessie64 branch=crux make build

  # For VyOS 1.3 (equuleus)
  $ os=buster64 branch=equuleus make build

  # For VyOS 1.4 (sagitta)
  $ os=buster64 branch=sagitta make build

Start the build:

.. code-block:: none

  # For VyOS 1.2 (crux) and VyOS 1.3 (equuleus)
  vyos_bld@8153428c7e1f:/vyos$ ./configure --architecture amd64 --build-by "j.randomhacker@vyos.io"
  vyos_bld@8153428c7e1f:/vyos$ sudo make iso

  # For VyOS 1.4 (sagitta) For VyOS 1.5 (circinus,current)
  vyos_bld@8153428c7e1f:/vyos$ sudo make clean
  vyos_bld@8153428c7e1f:/vyos$ sudo ./build-vyos-image iso --architecture amd64 --build-by "j.randomhacker@vyos.io"

When the build is successful, the resulting iso can be found inside the
``build`` directory as ``live-image-[architecture].hybrid.iso``.

Good luck!

.. hint:: Building VyOS on Windows WSL2 with Docker integrated into WSL2 will
   work like a charm. No problems are known so far!

.. _iso_build_issues:

ISO Build Issues
----------------

There are (rare) situations where building an ISO image is not possible at all
due to a broken package feed in the background. APT is not very good at
reporting the root cause of the issue. Your ISO build will likely fail with a
more or less similar looking error message:

.. code-block:: none

  The following packages have unmet dependencies:
   vyos-1x : Depends: accel-ppp but it is not installable
  E: Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages.

  (10:13) vyos_bld ece068908a5b:/vyos [current] #

To debug the build process and gain additional information of what could be the
root cause, you need to use `chroot` to change into the build directory. This is
explained in the following step by step procedure:

.. code-block:: none

  vyos_bld ece068908a5b:/vyos [current] # sudo chroot build/chroot /bin/bash

We now need to mount some required, volatile filesystems

.. code-block:: none

  (live)root@ece068908a5b:/# mount -t proc none /proc
  (live)root@ece068908a5b:/# mount -t sysfs none /sys
  (live)root@ece068908a5b:/# mount -t devtmpfs none /dev

We now are free to run any command we would like to use for debugging, e.g.
re-installing the failed package after updating the repository.

.. code-block:: none

  Reading package lists... Done
  Building dependency tree
  Reading state information... Done
  Some packages could not be installed. This may mean that you have
  requested an impossible situation or if you are using the unstable
  distribution that some required packages have not yet been created
  or been moved out of Incoming.
  The following information may help to resolve the situation:

  The following packages have unmet dependencies:
   vyos-1x : Depends: accel-ppp but it is not installable
  E: Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages.

Now it's time to fix the package mirror and rerun the last step until the
package installation succeeds again!

.. _build_custom_packages:

Linux Kernel
============

The Linux kernel used by VyOS is heavily tied to the ISO build process. The
file ``data/defaults.json`` hosts a JSON definition of the kernel version used
``kernel_version`` and the ``kernel_flavor`` of the kernel which represents the
kernel's LOCAL_VERSION. Both together form the kernel version variable in the
system:

.. code-block:: none

  vyos@vyos:~$ uname -r
  6.1.52-amd64-vyos

* Accel-PPP
* Intel NIC drivers
* Inter QAT

Each of those modules holds a dependency on the kernel version and if you are
lucky enough to receive an ISO build error which sounds like:

.. code-block:: none

  I: Create initramfs if it does not exist.
  Extra argument '6.1.52-amd64-vyos'
  Usage: update-initramfs {-c|-d|-u} [-k version] [-v] [-b directory]
  Options:
   -k version     Specify kernel version or 'all'
   -c             Create a new initramfs
   -u             Update an existing initramfs
   -d             Remove an existing initramfs
   -b directory   Set alternate boot directory
   -v             Be verbose
  See update-initramfs(8) for further details.
  E: config/hooks/live/17-gen_initramfs.chroot failed (exit non-zero). You should check for errors.

The most obvious reasons could be:

* ``vyos-build`` repo is outdated, please ``git pull`` to update to the latest
  release kernel version from us.

* You have your own custom kernel `*.deb` packages in the `packages` folder but
  neglected to create all required out-of tree modules like Accel-PPP, Intel
  QAT or Intel NIC drivers

Building The Kernel
-------------------

The kernel build is quite easy, most of the required steps can be found in the
``vyos-build/packages/linux-kernel/Jenkinsfile`` but we will walk you through
it.

Clone the kernel source to `vyos-build/packages/linux-kernel/`:

.. code-block:: none

  $ cd vyos-build/packages/linux-kernel/
  $ git clone https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git

Check out the required kernel version - see ``vyos-build/data/defaults.json``
file (example uses kernel 4.19.146):

.. code-block:: none

  $ cd vyos-build/packages/linux-kernel/linux
  $ git checkout v4.19.146
  Checking out files: 100% (61536/61536), done.
  Note: checking out 'v4.19.146'.

  You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
  changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
  state without impacting any branches by performing another checkout.

  If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
  do so (now or later) by using -b with the checkout command again. Example:

    git checkout -b <new-branch-name>

  HEAD is now at 015e94d0e37b Linux 4.19.146

Now we can use the helper script ``build-kernel.sh`` which does all the
necessary voodoo by applying required patches from the
`vyos-build/packages/linux-kernel/patches` folder, copying our kernel
configuration ``x86_64_vyos_defconfig`` to the right location, and finally
building the Debian packages.

.. note:: Building the kernel will take some time depending on the speed and
   quantity of your CPU/cores and disk speed. Expect 20 minutes
   (or even longer) on lower end hardware.

In the end you will be presented with the kernel binary packages which you can
then use in your custom ISO build process, by placing all the `*.deb` files in
the vyos-build/packages folder where they will be used automatically when
building VyOS as documented above.

Firmware
^^^^^^^^

If you upgrade your kernel or include new drivers you may need new firmware.
Build a new ``vyos-linux-firmware`` package with the included helper scripts.

.. code-block:: none

  $ cd vyos-build/packages/linux-kernel
  $ git clone https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/firmware/linux-firmware.git
  $ ./build-linux-firmware.sh
  $ cp vyos-linux-firmware_*.deb ../

This tries to automatically detect which blobs are needed based on which drivers
were built. If it fails to find the correct files you can add them manually to
``vyos-build/packages/linux-kernel/build-linux-firmware.sh``:

.. code-block:: bash

  ADD_FW_FILES="iwlwifi* ath11k/QCA6390/*/*.bin"


Building Out-Of-Tree Modules
----------------------------

Building the kernel is one part, but now you also need to build the required
out-of-tree modules so everything is lined up and the ABIs match. To do so,
you can again take a look at ``vyos-build/packages/linux-kernel/Jenkinsfile``
to see all of the required modules and their selected versions. We will show
you how to build all the current required modules.

Accel-PPP
^^^^^^^^^

First, clone the source code and check out the appropriate version by running:

.. code-block:: none

  $ cd vyos-build/packages/linux-kernel
  $ git clone https://github.com/accel-ppp/accel-ppp.git

We again make use of a helper script and some patches to make the build work.
Just run the following command:

.. code-block:: none

  $ ./build-accel-ppp.sh
  I: Build Accel-PPP Debian package
  CMake Deprecation Warning at CMakeLists.txt:3 (cmake_policy):
    The OLD behavior for policy CMP0003 will be removed from a future version
    of CMake.

    The cmake-policies(7) manual explains that the OLD behaviors of all
    policies are deprecated and that a policy should be set to OLD only under
    specific short-term circumstances.  Projects should be ported to the NEW
    behavior and not rely on setting a policy to OLD.

After compiling the packages you will find yourself the newly generated `*.deb`
binaries in ``vyos-build/packages/linux-kernel`` from which you can copy them
to the ``vyos-build/packages`` folder for inclusion during the ISO build.

Intel NIC
^^^^^^^^^

The Intel NIC drivers do not come from a Git repository, instead we just fetch
the tarballs from our mirror and compile them.

Simply use our wrapper script to build all of the driver modules.

.. code-block:: none

  ./build-intel-drivers.sh
    % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current

repository, instead we just fetch the tarballs from 01.org, Intel's
open-source website.

Packages
========

If you are brave enough to build yourself an ISO image containing any modified
package from our GitHub organisation - this is the place to be.

Any "modified" package may refer to an altered version of e.g. vyos-1x package
that you would like to test before filing a pull request on GitHub.

Building an ISO with any customized package is in no way different than
building a regular (customized or not) ISO image. Simply place your modified
`*.deb` package inside the `packages` folder within `vyos-build`. The build
process will then pickup your custom package and integrate it into your ISO.

Troubleshooting
===============

Debian APT is not very verbose when it comes to errors. If your ISO build breaks
for whatever reason and you suspect it's a problem with APT dependencies or
installation you can add this small patch which increases the APT verbosity
during ISO build.

Virtualization Platforms
========================

QEMU
----

Run the following command after building the ISO image.

.. code-block:: none

  $ make qemu

VMware
------

Run the following command after building the QEMU image.

.. code-block:: none

  $ make vmware

********
Packages
********

VyOS itself comes with a bunch of packages that are specific to our system and
thus cannot be found in any Debian mirror. Those packages can be found at the
`VyOS GitHub project`_ in their source format can easily be compiled into
a custom Debian (`*.deb`) package.

The easiest way to compile your package is with the above mentioned
:ref:`build_docker` container, it includes all required dependencies for
all VyOS related packages.

Assume we want to build the vyos-1x package on our own and modify it to our
needs. We first need to clone the repository from GitHub.

.. code-block:: none

  $ git clone https://github.com/vyos/vyos-1x

Build
=====

Launch Docker container and build package

.. code-block:: none

  # For VyOS 1.3 (equuleus, current)
  $ docker run --rm -it --privileged -v $(pwd):/vyos -w /vyos vyos/vyos-build:current bash

  # Change to source directory
  $ cd vyos-1x

  # Build DEB
  $ dpkg-buildpackage -uc -us -tc -b

After a minute or two you will find the generated DEB packages next to the
vyos-1x source directory:

.. code-block:: none

  # ls -al ../vyos-1x*.deb
  -rw-r--r-- 1 vyos_bld vyos_bld 567420 Aug  3 12:01 ../vyos-1x_1.3dev0-1847-gb6dcb0a8_all.deb
  -rw-r--r-- 1 vyos_bld vyos_bld   3808 Aug  3 12:01 ../vyos-1x-vmware_1.3dev0-1847-gb6dcb0a8_amd64.deb

Install
=======

To take your newly created package on a test drive you can simply SCP it to a
running VyOS instance and install the new `*.deb` package over the current
running one.

Just install using the following commands:

.. code-block:: none

  vyos@vyos:~$ dpkg --install /tmp/vyos-1x_1.3dev0-1847-gb6dcb0a8_all.deb
  (Reading database ... 58209 files and directories currently installed.)
  Preparing to unpack .../vyos-1x_1.3dev0-1847-gb6dcb0a8_all.deb ...
  Unpacking vyos-1x (1.3dev0-1847-gb6dcb0a8) over (1.3dev0-1847-gb6dcb0a8) ...
  Setting up vyos-1x (1.3dev0-1847-gb6dcb0a8) ...
  Processing triggers for rsyslog (8.1901.0-1) ...

You can also place the generated `*.deb` into your ISO build environment to
include it in a custom iso, see :ref:`build_custom_packages` for more
information.

.. warning:: Any packages in the packages directory will be added to the iso
   during build, replacing the upstream ones. Make sure you delete them (both
   the source directories and built deb packages) if you want to build an iso
   from purely upstream packages.
