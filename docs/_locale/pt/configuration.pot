Instead of balancing traffic across all healthy interfaces, only the primary interface is used and in case of failure, a secondary interface selected from the pool of available interfaces takes over. The primary interface is selected based on its weight and health, others become secondary interfaces. Secondary interfaces to take over a failed primary interface are chosen from the load balancer's interface pool, depending on their weight and health. Interface roles can also be selected based on rule order by including interfaces in balancing rules and ordering those rules accordingly.

msgid ":abbr:`MPLS (Multi-Protocol Label Switching)` is a packet forwarding paradigm which differs from regular IP forwarding. Instead of IP addresses being used to make the decision on finding the exit interface, a router will instead use an exact match on a 32 bit/4 byte header called the MPLS label. This label is inserted between the ethernet (layer 2) header and the IP (layer 3) header. One can statically or dynamically assign label allocations, but we will focus on dynamic allocation of labels using some sort of label distribution protocol (such as the aptly named Label Distribution Protocol / LDP, Resource Reservation Protocol / RSVP, or Segment Routing through OSPF/ISIS). These protocols allow for the creation of a unidirectional/unicast path called a labeled switched path (initialized as LSP) throughout the network that operates very much like a tunnel through the network. An easy way of thinking about how an MPLS LSP actually forwards traffic throughout a network is to think of a GRE tunnel. They are not the same in how they operate, but they are the same in how they handle the tunneled packet. It would be good to think of MPLS as a tunneling technology that can be used to transport many different types of packets, to aid in traffic engineering by allowing one to specify paths throughout the network (using RSVP or SR), and to generally allow for easier intra/inter network transport of data packets."
