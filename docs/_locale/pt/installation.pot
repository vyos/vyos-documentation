msgid "When the underlying ESXi host is approaching ~92% memory utilisation it will start the balloon process in a 'soft' state to start reclaiming memory from guest operating systems. This causes an artificial pressure using the vmmemctl driver on memory usage on the virtual guest. As VyOS by default does not have a swap file, this vmmemctl pressure is unable to force processes to move in memory data to the paging file, and blindly consumes memory forcing the virtual guest into a low memory state with no way to escape. The balloon can expand to 65% of guest allocated memory, so a VyOS guest running >35% of memory usage, can encounter an out of memory situation, and trigger the kernel oom_kill process. At this point a weighted lottery favouring memory hungry processes will be run with the unlucky winner being terminated by the kernel."
