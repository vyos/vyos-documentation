msgstr "We only want to export the networks we know. Always do a whitelist on your route filters, both importing and exporting. A good rule of thumb is **'If you are not the default router for a network, don't advertise it'**. This means we explicitly do not want to advertise the 192.0.2.0/24 network (but do want to advertise 10.200.201.0 and 203.0.113.0, which we ARE the default route for). This filter is applied to ``redistribute connected``. If we WERE to advertise it, the remote machines would see 192.0.2.21 available via their default route, establish the connection, and then OSPF would say '192.0.2.0/24 is available via this tunnel', at which point the tunnel would break, OSPF would drop the routes, and then 192.0.2.0/24 would be reachable via default again. This is called 'flapping'."
