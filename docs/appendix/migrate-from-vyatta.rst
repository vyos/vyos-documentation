Migrate from vyatta
===================

VyOS 1.x.x line aims to preserve backward compatibility and provide a safe upgrade path for existing Vyatta Core users. You may think of 1.0.0 as VC7.0.

Vyatta release compatiblity
---------------------------
Vyatta Core releases from **6.5** to **6.6** should be 100% compatible.

Vyatta Core **6.4** and earlier may have incompatibilities. In **6.5** the "modify" firewall was removed and replaced with "set policy route" command family, and old config cannot be automatically converted. You will have to adapt it to post-6.5 syntax manually.

.. NOTE::
  Also, in **6.5** remote access VPN interfaces were renamed from pppX to l2tpX and pptpX, so if you are using zone-policy in pre-6.5 versions, make sure to change interface names in rules for remote access VPN.

Upgrade procedure
-----------------
You just use "add system image", as if it was a new VC release. The only thing is that is you want to verify image digital signature, you will have to add the public key.

.. code-block:: sh

  vyatta@vyatta:~$ '''wget http://vyos.net/so3group_maintainers.key'''
  Connecting to vyos.net (85.159.113.32:80)
  so3group_maintainers 100% |***************************************************************************
  ********************************************************************|  3125  --:--:-- ETA
  vyatta@vyatta:~$ '''sudo apt-key add so3group_maintainers.key'''
  OK
  vyatta@vyatta:~$

Next, we can add the VyOS image.

Note that Vyatta doesn't support HTTP redirects for **add system image** and the http://mirror.vyos.net HTTP load-balancer links will not work. Instead, choose one of the `mirrors <https://wiki.vyos.net/wiki/Mirrors>`_ and get a direct link.

This example uses 1.0.0 image, however, it's better to install the latest release.

.. code-block:: sh

  vyatta@vyatta:~$ show system image

   vyatta@vyatta:~$ 

Upon reboot, you should have a working installation of VyOS.

You can go back to your Vyatta install using the **set system image default-boot** command and selecting the your previous Vyatta image.

Note that future releases of VyOS may break compatibility with Vyatta.
