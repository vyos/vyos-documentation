# Custom block scoping (see the regex101 links for unit tests):
#
# Rule #1 (https://regex101.com/r/TJQLJ4/2/tests): Ignore `{%comment%}` blocks. This
# keeps Vale from flagging 'endcomment' as a spelling mistake.
#
# Rule #2 (https://regex101.com/r/7VA2lV/2/tests): Ignore `<div>`s and `<section>`s
# that specify `markdown="1"` since it isn't supported by Vale's Markdown
# parser (https://github.com/russross/blackfriday/issues/184).
#
# Rule #3 (https://regex101.com/r/NxFflU/1/tests): Ignore `{% include %}`-codeblock
# pairs.
